LETTERS TO ATTICUS 1. 16

Q jury could aequit Clodius, I drew in a reef or two,
not being blind ΜΕ impecuniosity of the jurymen.
Iconfined my testimony to points so thffoughly well-

’ known and attested that I could not omit thern. So,
⁴ to come at last to the “ horse,'' if you want to know

the reason for his acquittal, it lay Qury's lach-of
pence and of conscience. But it was Hortensius’
¹ plan that {nade‘s‘uch a result possible. In his fright
that Fufius might veto the Senate’s measure, he
overlooked the xfact that it would be better for Clo-
dius to be kept in disgrace with a trial hanging over
his head, than for the case to come before an unsound
⁴ court. Spurred on by hatred, he rushed the matter
into court, saying that a leaden sword was sharp

’ enough to cut Clodius' throat. '⁴
’5. If you want to know about the trial, the result of
¹ it was so incredible that now after the event every-
body agrees with my forebodings and blames Hor-
tensius The challenging of the jury took placd
amidst an uproar‚ since the prosecutor like a good
¹ censor rejected all the knaves, and the defendant like
'a kind-hearted trainer of gladiators set aside all the
respectable people. And as soon as the jury took
their seatS, the patriotic party began to have grave
misgivings: for never did a more disreputable set of
people get togetherheven in a gambling hell.
Senators with a past, knights without a penny,
tribunes whose only right t0 a title implying pay lay
” ’ in their readiness to take it.¹ The few honest folk
’ among thern, that he ha‘d not managed to remove in

his selection, sat as woe-begone as fish out of water,

‘ 'Or keeping the ordinary sense of “ aerarii'': “ cashicred
- rathersthan rich in cash.” But the sense both of “aerati '⁹ -
and of “aerarii ”here is very doubtful.
