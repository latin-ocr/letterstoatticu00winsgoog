LETTERS TO A'ITICUS 111. 23

that section need be taken seriously-—yet when it
came to repealing the law, became so cautious that
they feared a rule, which even those who are bound
by the lawdo not regard‚thoughthey themselves were
not bound by it. That clause Ι would rather the new
tribunes did not propose; but do let them pass
something—anything. Ι shall be quite contented
with a single clause of recall, if only the matter can
’ be settled. For some time past Ι have been ashamed
, of writing such long letters. For by the time you
read this Ι am afraid that there may be no hope left,
and that all my trouble may serve only ¹to make you
pity and others laugh. But, if there is any hope lest,
look at the bill which Visellius has drawn up for
Fadius: it takes my fancy very much, whereas our
friend Sestius’ proposal, which you say has your ap·
proval, does not please me at all.

s} The third letter is dated November 12, and in it

you go through the reasons which you think are
causing delay in my case, thoughtfully and carefully,

mentioning Crassus, Pompey and the rest. Now, if
there is the least chance of getting the matter settled
by the good offices and authority of the conservatives
and by getting a large mass of supportem, for heaven’s
sake try to break the barrier down at a rush: devote
yourself to it and incite others to join. But if, as I in·
fer from your guesses as well as mine, there is no hope
lest, then Ι beg and pray you to cherish my poor
brother Quintus, whom Ι have involved in my own·
ruin, and not to let him pursue any rash course which
would endanger your sister’s sou. Wateh over my ,
poor little boy, to whom l leave nothing but the
hatred and the disgrace of my name, so far as you
can, and support Terentia with your kindness in her
