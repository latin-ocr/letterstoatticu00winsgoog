LETTERS TO ATTICUS VI. 2

After spending the month of June there (andl pray

it may be in peace, for a serious war ¹with the Par-

2 - thians is certainly coming), J uly I shall spend on my

journey home. Ishall have served my year on July

the aoth. 1 have great hopes that my tenure of

³ office may not beextended. Ihave the city gazette

y up to the 7th of March. I gather that, thanks to

the persistence of my friend Curio, appointments to

the province will be the last business to be con·
sidered. So, as 1 hope, Ι shall see you soon.

l come now to BrutuS, your friend or rather mine,

since you prefer it Ι have done everything that I

could accomplish in my own province or attempt

in the kingdom of Cappadocia. l have taken every
measure with the king and still do so daily—by

letter. Τ11ε king himself was in my company only
i for three or four days and at a crisis in his affairs,

¹ from which I released him. But both then in person
and subsequently in repeated letters I have con·

tinually begged and besought him in my own name .
and advised and persuaded him in his own interest.
My efforts have borne fruit: but how* much at this
distance l cannot tell for certain. The people of
Salamis however, whom Icould influence, 1 have
induced to consent to settle all their debt with
Scaptius but with interest at 12 per cent calcu-
lated from the date of the last contract, and not at
simple but compound interest. The money was counted
down: but Scaptius refused to take it. What kind of
a figure do you cut, who say that Brutus will make a
sacrificerForry-eight per cent waswr'itteninthebond.
It was an impossible sum. It could not be paid nor
could Ι have permitted it. Ι hear after all that
