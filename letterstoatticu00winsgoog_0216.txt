’ Please attribute my sudden departure from Vibo Between
aster asking you to join me there to my misery rather V lb⁰ alul
than to caprice. Ι received a copy of the bill for my B'wldmum
destruction, and found that, the alteration of which Ι Apr'ss'
v had heard, took the form of banishment beyond four Μ’ ’
hundred miles. Since Ι could netgo where Ι wished,
Ι went straight to Brundisium before the bill was

. passed, for sear of infflng my host Sicca in my

destruction and because Ι am not permitted to stay

yet Malta Now make haste and jein me, if Ι can find
, 'anyone to take me in. At present Ι receive kind in- .

vitations: but I fear the future. Ι indeed, Pom-

poniae, am heartily sick of life: and it is mainly sor

your sake that Ι consented to live. But of this when

we meet. Please do come.
