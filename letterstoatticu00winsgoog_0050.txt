Taverns; another brought by your host at Canusium;

andathirdwhich you say you posted fromthe boatjust

' as you got under weiglr. All three of thern were, as

ι a pupil in the rhetorical schools would say, at once

sprinkled with the saltos refinement and stamped

l , 1, with the brand of affection. They certainly provoke an

’ , answer: but I have becn rather slow about sending

. one, for lack of a safe messenger. There are very

, few who can carry a letter of weight without light-

ening it by a perusal. BesideS, I don’t hear of every,

traveller to Epirus For I suppose, when you have

at once to lay siege to Sicyon, I'm not certain

' ’ either how or when you are going to join Antony or ·

, trust at all outspoken letters to people going either

them to the risk of the letters being either lost or

opened or intercepted. QFnst then let me tell you I
