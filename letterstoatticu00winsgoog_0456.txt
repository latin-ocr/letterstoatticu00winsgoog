give my greetingstoboth of them in return. The date
of your letter, the last day of December, reminded
me pleasantly of the famous and unforgotten oath Ι

' took¹ lwas a Pompey in state robes that day.

There you have my answer to all your points: notas

’ you asked “gold for copper,’' but like for like.

 

Tbere was another short letter which Ι will not

, leave unanswered. Lucceius to be sure was able to

do something for the villa at Tusculum, unless per-
haps there was the old obstacle of the flute player23
and Ι should like to know its condition. Our friend
Lentulus 1 hear has advertised all his property except
that at Tusculum. Ι should like to see these gentle-
men free from debt as well as Sestius and you may
add Caelius too. To all of them one may apply the
quotation, “ashamed to refuse, but yet afraid to
take.’' Ι suppose you have heard of Curio’s idea to re-
call Memmius. As for the debt due from Egnatius of

ζ Sidicinum‚lhavesomehope,butnotmuch. Deiotarus
is taking very great care of Pinarius, whom you

recommended to me, in a serious illness. So there
is my answer to your little letter.

While 1 am at Laodicea, which will be up to the
15th of May, please correspond with me as often as
possible, and on your arrival at Athens at any rate
send me letter carrierS, since by that time we shall
know what has been done in town and about the
provinces, of which the affairs are settled in March.

By the bye have you yet got Herodes to wring from
Caesar that 312900? ⁴l hear you have excited the
animosity of Pompey in the matter. He thinks that

¹Cicer0' refers to the day on which he laid down the

consulship. Cf. Ad Fam. v, 23 Ι ¹
ΙΟ( “ prop.'’ But the whole passage rs uncertain.
