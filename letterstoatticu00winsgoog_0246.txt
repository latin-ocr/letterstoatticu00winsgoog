LETTERS TO ATTICUS 111. 15

³ You mention talkingtoCulleo about this bill being
directed against an individual.l There is something

in that point: but it is much better to have it re·

- motion or reference to my case, has been posted upl,
¹ in the House. How then does Domitius propose to
make a motion? And how is it that Clodius holds
his tongue, when the men you mention talk about
the case and ask for a motion? And, if you think
