LETTERS TO AT'I'ICUS ll. 21
tinguish it The result is that now Bibulus’ scathing¹

edicts against him are so popular, that one can't pass
the place where they are posted up for the crowd of
people reading them. Pompey finds them so dis·
tressing, that he is wasting away with grief; and l
myself am much annoyed with them, partly because
they cause so much pain to a man whom I have always
loved, and partly for sear that being so impulsive and
ready to draw the sword, as well as so unused to abuse,
he may give full reins to his indignation and wrath.
Ι don’t know what will be the end of Bibulus.
As things stand at present his reputation is extra-
ordinarily high. When he put off the elections till
October, which generally annoys the populace, Caesar

thought he could induce the people by a speech to .

attack Bibulus: but in spite of all his seditious talk, he
could not ring aword out ofanybody. In short they feel
that they have lost the goodwill of all parties: and so
violent action on their part is all the moreto be feared.

Clodius is hostile to me. Pompey assures me he
will do nothing against me: but Ι am afraid to trust
him and am getting ready for resistanoe. Ι hope Ι
shall have very strong support· from all classes. For ⁴
your presence Ι have a longing myself and circum·
stances call for it ‘to meet the crisis. lf Ι see you
in time, 1 shall feel it a great accession to my policy,
my courage and my safety. Varro is very obliging;
ἶ and Pompey talks like an angel. Ihope thatin the
end Ι shall either be certain of a glorious victory, or
even escape unmolested. Let me know what you
are doing, how you are enjoying yourself, and what
, has happened as regards the Sicyonians.

scathing iambic verses.
