I am sure you must recollect my former life and its

eharm and dignity. In the name of good luck and

bad, do not let the efforts you are making to recover

my position relax; and let me celebrate the birth-

and my family. Though my hopes and expectations

of return have been roused to the highest pitch, I

still thought of awaiting their fulfilment at your house

in Epirus: but from letters Ι inferit would be more

convenientior me not to be in the same neighbour-

hood.
