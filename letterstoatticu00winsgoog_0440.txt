office to a business man, which I made also to our
friend Torquatus in the case 01 your acquaintance
Laenius, and to Pompey himself inv the case of Sex.

Statius, without annoying either 01 them3 if he is .
angry at the disbanding 01 his cavalry, well 1 shall · · =

11 Brutus’ brother-in-law, PauluS, comes here? 1
allowed Brutus all this privilege:¹ and 110 has written
