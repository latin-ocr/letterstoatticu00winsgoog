· LETTERS TO ATI'ICUS Ι. 8

cicaro ro amicus, susurrus.
, All‘s well-as well as could be desired—at home. Rome
l Quintus and 1 are looking aster your mother and ψῃ 'Jeep
sister. l’ve spoken to Acutilius. He says his bro- 13, M, 67

ker has not advised him, and is much surprised
there should have been such a fuss because he
refused to guarantee that there should beno further
elaims on you. The settlement that you have
r arranged about Tadius' affairs is, Ι am sure, very
¹ good news for him, and he is pleased about it. That
friend of mine, who is really quite a good soul and
very amiable to me, is exceedingly annoyed with
ι you. When l know how deeply you take it to heart,

1 may be able to lay my plans accordingly.
Ι have raised the ‚2180l for L. Cincius for the
γ statues of Megaric marble, as you advised me. Those
figures of Hermes in Pentelic marble with bronze
heads, about which you wrote, Ι have already fallen
in love with: so please send them and anythin else
that you think suits the place, and my enthuh‘asm
for such things, and your own taste-—the more the
marrier, and the sooner the better-especially those
you intend for the Gymnasium arrd the colonnade.
For my appreciation for art treasures is so great that
Ι am afraid most people will laugh at me, though Ι
expect encouragement from you. If none'of Lentulus’
boats are coming, put them on any ship you like.
My little darling, Tullia, keeps asking for your
promised present and duns me as though Ι were
ι answerable for you. But Ι am going to deny my

⁸ obligation rather than pay up.
