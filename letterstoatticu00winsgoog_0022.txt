LETTERS TO ATTICUS Ι. 1

tolie between Thermus and Silanus. But they are

ι
Ι so unpopular and so unknown, that it seems to me to
be on the cards to smuggle' ιιι Curius Nobody else
thinks so, however It would probably suit our
book best for Thermus to get ιιι with Caesar: for, of
the present batch of candidates, he would be the
most formidable rival if he were put off ιο my year, .
as he rs commissioner for the repairing of the Fla-
{inl an road That will easily be finished by then:
Ι should like to lump him together with Caesar
now. Such rs the present rough guess of the
Ι chauces of the candidates.“l shall take the greatest
care to fulfil all a candidate’s duties: and, as Gaul's
vote counts high, Ι shall probably get a free pass
and take a run up to visit Piso, as soon as things
have quieted down in the law courts here, returning
in J anuary. When Ι have discovered the views of the
upper ten, Ι will let you know. The rest Ι hope will
be plain sailing, with my civilian rivals ar any rate.
, For· our friend Pompey's followers you must be re-
sponsible, as you are quite close to them. Tell him
Ι shall not take it unkindly if he does not come to
my election. So much for that.
But there is a thing for which I have ιο orave
ι your pardon. Your uncle, Caecilius, was cheated
Ι out of a large sum of money by P. Varius, and has
taken an action against his brother, A. Caninius
‚ Satyrus about some property which he says was
fraudulently made over to him by Varius. The other
’ creditors have made common cause with him: and
¹ among them are L. Lucullus and P. Scipio and the
man who was expected to act for them at the sale,

if the goods were put up for auction, L. Pontius.
