thanks to the Senate¹ in the House. On those two
days bread was very dear and crowds ran first to the ¹ ,

world for five years: Messius another granting him
the control of the treasu'ry‚ and adding an army and

ξ a fleet and higher powers than those of the local
· officials in the provinces. The law we ers-consuls
, proposed is regarded now as quite moderate, this
