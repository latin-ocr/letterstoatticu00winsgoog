LETTERS TO ATTICUS 11. 7

Caesar's house, now he has not a footing even among
twenty; and in the second place, one embassy is
talked of, and another is given to him, That fat
post for levying money is reserved for Drusus of

J' Pisaurum, Ι suppose, or for the gourmand Vatinius
χ while this barren messcnger’s job is given to him,

and his tribunate too has to wait their convenience„ .
Fire the fellow's resentmcnt plcase, as much as you
can. My one hope of safety lies in their mutual
disagreement: and from Curio Ι gather that there is
a hint of such a thing. Arrius is beginning to rage
at being robbed of his consulship: Megabocchus and

the rest of that bloodthirsty band of youths are at .

daggers drawn with them. And God grant there
may come a dispute about this augurship on the top.
Ι hope Ι shall have occasion to send you some of my
very best letters and plenty of them on these topics.

But Ι am anxious to know the meaning of that
dark hint of yours, that even some of the board of

y five commissionem are speaking their minds. What

on earth can it be? If there really is anything in it,
things are in a better way than I thought Please
don’ t imagine that 1 ask the question with aview to
action, because my soul rs yearning to take part m
politica Ι have long been sick of holding the helm,
even when I was allowed to do so: and now, when Ι
have been marooned and the helm tom from my
grasp without waiting for me to surrender it, my
only desire is to watch their shipwreck from the dry
land. Ἰ could wish, as your friend Sophocles sayS,

·“In peaceful slumber sunk
Το hear the pattering raindrops on the roof.'’

About the wall you will see what rs necessary Ι
