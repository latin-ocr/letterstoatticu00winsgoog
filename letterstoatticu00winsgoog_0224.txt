LETTERS To ATTICUS ΙΙΙ. 8

Athens, the other that he was coming by land through
Macedonia. So Ι senta note to catch him at Athens,
asking him to come on to Thessalonica, and Ι mysels

set off and arrived at Thessalonica on the ssssrd of
May. The only certain news about him, that Ι have

had, is that he started a short time ago from Ephesus ⁴

Now l am in great anxiety to know what is happening
at Rome. Itis true thatin one letter dated May 15
you say you have heard that Quintus will be rigor·
ously called in question, and in another that things ·
are cahning down: but the latter is dated a day be·

hardly any life lest in me. But the passage was very
bad and perhaps, not knowing where l was, he took
some other direction. My freedman Phaetho has seen
nothing of him. Phaetho was driven back· by wind
from llium to Macedonia and came to me at Pella
Ι see how threatening the future is, though Ι have
not the heart to write. Ι am afraid of everything:
there is no misfortune that does not seem to fall ιο
my lot. Ι am still staying in suspense at Thessa-
lonica, with this new fear added to the woes and
sorrows that oppress me3 and Ι do not dare ιο make
a move of any kind. ‚ ’

Now for the things you mention in your letter.
Caecilius Trypho Ι have not seen. Of your talk with
Pompey l have heard from your letter. lcannot see
such signs of a political change as you either see or
invent to comfort me: for, if they take no notice of
the Tigranes episode, all hope is lost. You bid me
pay my thanks to Varro. Ι will, and to Hypsaeus
too. Ithiuk I will follow your advice not to go any
