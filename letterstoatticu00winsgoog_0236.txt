LETTERS TO ATTICUS ΙΙΙ. 12-13

hopeless please give your attention to the matter3
but if Ι am past praying for, then Ι don’t' much mind
about it. '
. Ι am still lying dormant at the same place, and
neither speak nor think. Though, as you say, Ι did
suggest that you should come to me, I see now that
you are useful to me where you are, while here you ’
could not find even a word of comfort to lighten my
sorrows. Ι cannot write more, nor have Ι anything
to say. Therefore,l am all the more anxious for
your news. Ι

Thessalonica, July 17. ,

xm ’ . ν

cicaro ro armeus, anuarino.

, Ι changed my mind about the proposed journey to Thessa-
Epirus when Ι saw my hope growing less and less lonira Aug.
and finally vanishing, and have not moved from 5, ac. 53
Thessalonica, where Ι proposed to stay till you should
send me some news of what you mentioned on Pom-
pey’s authority in your last letter, that my ease might
come before the House after the elections And s0,
now the elections are over and Ι get no news from
you, l shall take that as equivalent to your writing
and saying that nothing has come of it, nor shall Ι Δ
regret that the hope which buoyed me up has
not lasted long. As for the movement that
appeared to be in my favour, which you said you
foresaw new arrivals here assure me that it won't
come off. The only hope lestis in the tribunes elect ε
and if Γ wait till that is settled, you will have no
right to regard meas a traitor to my own cause and

ἵ to my friends’ wishes¹
