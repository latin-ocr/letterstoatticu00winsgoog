crosno ro micae, ornemus.

Ι am much obliged to you for sending me Serapio’s Artium,
book, though between you and me Ι hardly under· April,
stand a thousandth part of it. Ι have given orders nc. 59
for you to be paid ready money for it, t0 prevent
your entering it among presentation copies. Since
1 am mentioning money matters, please settle up
with Titinius as best you can. If he won't stand by
his agreement, the best plan, so far as Ι can see,
will be to return the goods for which he made a
bad bargain, if Pomponia will consent to that course:
if even that won't work, then give him his money
back rather than have a fuss. I should be very glad
if you would finish the business before you leave,
with your usual kindness and carefuhress.

So Clodius is going to Tigranes you say! I wish
it were on the same terms as that Scepsian.¹ But Ι
don't envy him. It will be a much more convenient
time for me to get a free travelling pam, when my
brother Quintus has settled down in peace, as Ι hope
he will, and when I know the intentione of that
priest of Bona Dea.2 Meantime Ι shall settle down
to the enjoyment of the Muses with resignation, in-

'Metrodorus of Scepsus was sent by Mithridates to urge
Tigranes to wage war with Rome, but privately spoke

a ainstit He was therefore put to death by Mithridates
Clodius on account of his intrusion into the mysteri es

os hona Dea.
