LETTERS TO ATTICUS Ι. 19

was passed by the enthusiasm of the silent membersl

, without any support from our party. For as to my

χ signature which you find attached to it, you can see

from the decrec itself that it was quite a different
matter which was brought forward, and this clause
about the free peoples was added without rhyme or
reason. It was the work of P. Servilius the younger,
who was one of the last to speak: but it cannot be
altered at the present time. So the meetings which
at first were held about it have ceased long ago. Is,
however, you should manage to squeeze a few pence
out of the Sicyonians, please let me know.

s «ἱ Ι have sent you a copy of my account of my consul·
ship in Greek. If there is anything in it, which to
your Attic taste seems bad Greek or unscholarly, ·I »
will not say what Lucullus said to you—at Panhor-
mus, Ι think-about his history, that he had inter-
spersed a few barbarisms and solecisms as a clear»
proof that it was the work of a Roman. If there is
anything of the kind in my work, itisthere without my
knowledge and against my will. When Ι have finished
the Latin version,Iwill send itto you. lnthethirdplace
you may expect a poem, not to let slip any method
of singing my own praises. Please don’t quote “Who
will praise his sire ? ”² For if there is any more fitting
subjectior eulogy, then Ι am willing to be blamed

j for not choosing some oth'er subject. However my
compositions are· not panegyrics at all but histories.

u. My brother· Quintus has wsritten exculpating him-
self and declaringv that he never said a word against

¹Members who did not speak, but only took part in the
ῃ division (pedibus ire in sententiam).

²The whole proverb is found in Plutarch's Life of Aratus. ,
