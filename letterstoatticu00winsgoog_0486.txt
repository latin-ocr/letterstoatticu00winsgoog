LETTERS TO ATTICUS VI. 5

the land, and had some hopes' When he lost them,
he left without an explanation, saying: “l give in,

'Twere shame to tarry long,”. and casting in my
teeth the old proverb ‘ take the goods the gods pro-
vide you.'’l Look alter the rest, and let us investi-
gate the matter as thoroughly as possible.

Though Ι have nearly served my year (for only
thirty-three days remain), still I am greatly concerned
about my province. Syria is ablaze with war, and
Bibulus is burdened with its cares in the midst of
his own great sorrow,2 and his legateS, quaestor and
friends write to me to go to his aid: so, although
the army Ι have is weak-the auxiliaries certainly
’ are good, Galatians, Pisidiam, Lyciam, the main
strength of my force-1 have thought it my duty to
keep an army facing the foe, so long as Ι am author-
ized by the Senate's decree to be in charge of my
province. But what pleases me greatly is that

Bibulus gives no trouble. He writes to me about '

Ἴ any other topic by preference, and the day of my
Ἴ departure creeps on unnoticed. When it arrives
' there is the further problem of my substitute, unless
my quaestor Caldus comes, of whom so far I have no
news. .

Ι should like to write a longer letter, but I have
no news, and care keeps me from jesting3 so good-
bye, and love to your little daughter and to your
wife.

given in full by olympiodorus in the fonn τὰ er τῆς τύχης
