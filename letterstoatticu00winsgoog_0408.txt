LETTERS TO ATTICUS V. 20

days at Cybistra in Cappadocia, Ι got information
that the Parthians were far distant from that entrance
into Cappadocia, and rather were threatening Cilicia.
So Ι made a forced march into Cilicia by the gates of
Taurus. Ι reached Tarsus on the 5th of October. .
Thence Ι hurried‘to Amanus, which divides Syria
from Cilicia by itswatershed, a mountain that has
always been full of our enemies. Here on the lssth
of October we cut up a large body of the enemy. I
captured some strongly fortified posts hya night

and we bumed them. Ι was hailed as “General.”
For a few days Ι pitched camp at the very spot near
Issus, where Alexander had camped against Darius.
He was rather a better general than you or Ι. We
plundered and devastated Amanus, and after a stay
of five days took our departure. Meantime (for you
know there are such words as “panio” and the “un-
certainties of war”) report of my arrival gave
heart to Cassius, who was shut up in Antioch, and it
inspired fear in the Parthians. So, as the Parthians
retreated from the town, Cassius pursued them and
scoredasuccess. In their retreat one of their leaders,
Osaces, a man of high rank, was wounded and died
a few days afterwards. I was in high favour in Syria.
Meantime Bibulus came. Ι fancy he wanted to be
my peer in the matter of that empty title. On
this same mountain Amanus he begins his task of
looking for a needle in a battle of hay.¹ But the
whole of his first squadron was lost as well as Asinius

Dent0‚ a centurion of the'first line and of noble
