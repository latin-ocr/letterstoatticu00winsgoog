Lamnus ro urricus 11. 1 ’

Favonius carried my tribe with even more credit
than his own, but lost that of Lucceius. His accu-
sation of Nasica was nothing to be proud of 3 how-
ever he conducted it very moderatcly. He spoke so
Ἰ badly that one would think he devoted more time at
l Rhodes to grinding in the mills than at Molo’s lec-
tures. I got into his bad books for undertaking the
defence3 however he is standing again now on public
grounds How Lucceius is getting on Iwill write
and tell you, when Ι have seen Caesar, who will be
here in a couple of days' time. The wrong the Sicy-
onians have done you you attribute to Cato and his
imitator Servilius. But does not the blow affcct
many good citizens? However, if it so pleases them,
let us acquiesce, and be utterly deserted at the next
question put to the vote.

My Amalthea is waiting and longing for you. I
am delighted with my places at Tusculum and Pom-
peii, except that, champion of creditors as l am, they
have overwhelmed me not so much with Corinthian
bronze as with debts in the common copper coin of
the realm. We hope things have settled down in
Gaul. Expect my Prognosticsl and my bits of speeches
very shortly: but for all that write and tell me your
plans about coming. Pomponia has sent a message
that you will be iu Rome in July: but that disagrees
with the letter you sent to me about placing your
name on the census list. ⁴

Paetus, as I have already mentioned, has given me
the books lest him by his brother: but this gist de·
pends on your kind services. As you love me, see
that they are preserved and brought to me. You

could do meno greater favour: and I should like the
ιΑ translation of Aratus' Διοσημεῖα.
