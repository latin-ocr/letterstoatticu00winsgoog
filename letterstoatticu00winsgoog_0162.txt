LE'ITERS TO ATTICUS ΙΙ. 12-13

to Gnaeus, the conversation with Theophanes and
Memmius: and you have made me wild with inqui-
sitiveness about that “fast '' dinner. My curiosity is
insatiable: but Ι have no grievance at your omitting
to write an account of the dinner. Ι would much
rather hear it by word of mouth.

As for your exhortations to write something, my
material certainly is increasing, as you say3 but
everything is still in a state of ferment, like must in
autumn. When things have settled down, my writing
will be more clarified. Though you may not get

anything from me at once, you shall be the first to
' have it however, and no one else for a long time.
You are right in admiring Dicaearchus. He is a
splendid fellow and a far better patriot than any of
> these great men of ours to whom his name would

certainly not apply.1 Ι write this on the day of the
Cerealia at four 0’clock‚ as soon as l read yours: but
Ι am thinking of giving it to the first person Ι meet
'oo-morrow. Terentia is delighted with your letters.
She sends you her warmest greetings, and Cicero in
his new rdle of philosopher salutes Titus the politician.

cronno ro amicus, osannae.

What a shame! The letter Iwrote on the spur Fanniae,
of the moment at the Three Taverns in answer to circa April
your delightful notes never reached you! The rea· 23, ac. 59
son was that the packet in which Ι had put it was
taken to my town house the same day, and brought
back to me at Fonniae. So Ι have had the letter sent

back to show you how pleased 1 was with yours.
¹Cicero puns on the name Dicaearchus (= “just ruler'').
