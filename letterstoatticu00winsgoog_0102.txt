2 cannot forbear adding here that when my lot came

up first in the ballot among the err-consuls the
Senate were unanimous in declaring that 1 should

be kept in Rome. The same happened to Pompey
’ after me, so that we two appear to be kept as
pledges of the State.¹-Why should Ι look for the “

for me at horne?

Wess, this is the state of affairs in the city. aThe
agrarian law was zealously pushed by the tribune
Flavius with the support of Pompey, though its only

ἱ claim to popularity was its supporter. My proposal ,

to remove from the law any points which encroached
on private rights was favourably received hya public
meeting. I proposed to exempt from its action such

t land as was public in the consulship of P. Mucius and
ι L: Calpurnius‚² to confirm Sulla’s veterans in their

possessions, to allow the people of Volaterra and
Arretium to retain in their holding their land which
Sulla had made public land, but had not distributed:
the only clause I did not reject was that land should
be purchased by this wind-fall which will come in
from the new foreign revenues in the next five years.
The Senate wa's opposed to the whole agrarian
scheme, suspecting that Pompey was aiming at
getting some new powers. Pompey had set his ,

, heart on carrying the law through. Ι on the other

hand, with the full approval of the applicants for
land, was for securing the holdings of all private
