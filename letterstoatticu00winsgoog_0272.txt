LETTERS TO ATTICUS 111. 24

not assented, they would have got their way all the
same through the people, that could never have
happened, if the tribunes opposed it. Solam afraid
that Ι have lost the tribunes’ favour, and that, if
it is still retained, 'the hond which should have
united the consuls with them has been lost

There is another considerable disadvantage too.
There was a strong opinion, or so at least it was re-

, ported to me, that the Senate would not pass any
³ measure until my case was settled. That is now lost,

and in a case where there was no necessity whatever3
indeed the proceeding was unusual and unprece·
dented. For Ι do not think the estimates for the
provinces were ever passed before the consuls entered
on their office. The result is that, now that the firm
resolution formed in favour of my case hasbeen
broken for this one occasion, there is no reason why
any decree should not be passed. Ι don’t wonder
that those friends to whom the question was referred
agreed to it: it would of course have been difficult to
find anyoue who would openly oppose a measure so

1 favourable to the two consuls. It would have been

very difficult too not to oblige so good a friend as
Lentulus, or Metellus, considering his kindness in
laying aside his quarrel with me. But Ι am afraid
that, while we could have retained their friendship
in any case, we have thrown away that of the tribunes.
Please write and tell me what the result has been,
and how my whole case stands, as freely as you have
before. For, however unpleasant the truth may be,
Ι am grateful for it. .
