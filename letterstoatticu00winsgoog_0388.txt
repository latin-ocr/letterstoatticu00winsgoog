LETTERS TO ATTICUS V. 13-14

l enough of this, especially as Cestius has interrupted
ι my dinner with news that he is starting to-night.¹¹
η ,Ι attended to your little jobs at Ephesus and
ξ although before my arrival Thermus had given the
i most lavish promises to all your people, still I intro-
duced Philogenes and Seius to him, and recommended
, Xeno of Apollonis. He undertook to do everything.
ln addition l submitted to Philogenes an account of
the sum Ι got from you by negotiating a bill of ¹
exchange So enough of this too.
Ireturn to town affairs. Since you are staying
, in Rome, in heaven's name, do support and establish
³ my plea to be let off with one year of office without
additions to the calendar. Execute all my commis-
sions3 particularly get over that hitch in my private
¹ affairs of which you are aware, and over the business
with Caesar. lt was you who led me to try to pay
my debt, and I am glad. lf you understand my
pervehunt to know and trouble about what is happening
¹ in public life, or rather what is going to happen, write
to me in full and with accuracy, especially whether '
χ there is any break-down at all in the trials that have
’ been held or are going to be held lf you are in·
terested about the aqueduct, and if the contractor is ⁴
at work, please give it your attention.
