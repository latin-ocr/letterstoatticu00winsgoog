LETTERS TO ATTICUS 111. 15
01 acting through the people, can it be managed

without the consent of all the tribunes? What about
my goods and chattels? What about my house? Will
they be restored? If not, how can I be? If you
don't see your way to managing that, what is it

-you want me to hope for? And, if there is nothing ’

to hope for, what sort of life can l lead? Under
these circumstances I am awaiting the gazette for
August 1 at Thessalonica, before l make up my mind
whether to take refuge on your estate, where I can
avoid seeing those 1 don’t wantto see, and see you,
as you point out in your letter, and be nearer at hand
if any aetion is being taken, or whether 1 shall go to
Cyzicus. 1 believe you and Quintus want me to keep
at hand. ’

Now, Pomponius, you used none of your wisdom
in saving me from ruin—either because you thought
1 had enough common sense myself, or because you
thought you owed me nothing but the support of
your presence: while l, basely betrayed and hurried

’ to my ruin, threw down my arms and fled, deserting

my country, though all Italy would have stood up and
defended me with enthusiasm. You looked on in
silence, while l betrayed myself, my family and my
possessions, to my enemieS, though, evenis you had
not more sense than l had, you certainly had less cause

a for panic. Now,if you can, raise me from my fall, and

’ in that render me assistance. But, if all ways are ,

blocked, let me know of the fact, and do not keep on
either reproaching me or olfering usl your sympathy.
If 1 had any fault to find with your loyalty,1 should
not trust myself to your house in preference to all
