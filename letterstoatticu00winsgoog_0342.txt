LETTERS ro Amicus 1v. 17

Favonius: Cato is ill. You need not be afraidfor
me, but I won't promise anything.
What else do you want to know? Oh! the trials,
Ι suppose. Drusus and Scaurus are thought to be
innocent. Three candidates will probably be prose-
cuted, Domitius by Memmius Messalla by Q. Pom-

³ Ι hear that {laesor shows signs of extraordinary
affection for me, and this is confirmed by a very eor-
dial letter from Caesar himself. The result of the
war in Britain is looked forward to with anxiety. For
it is proved that the approach to the island is guarded
ἵ with astonishing masses of roek‚ and it has been
ascertained too that there is not a serap of silver in

ἓ the island, nor any hope of booty except from slaves3

but Ι don’t fancy you will find any with literary or
musical talents among them.

Paulus has almost reached the roof of his colonnade
in the'Forum. He has used the'same- old columns,
but has executed most magnificently the part he put
out on contract. lt goes without saying that a
monument like that will win for him more popularity
and glory than anything. And so we friends of
Caesar—myself and Oppius I mean, though you may
explode with wrath at my confessionsshave thought
nothing of spending half a million of moneyl for that
public work of which you used to speak so enthusi-
astically, the extension of the Forum and continuation

3 of it as far as the Hall of Liberty. We could not

¹60‚ooo‚ooo sesterces. ·
