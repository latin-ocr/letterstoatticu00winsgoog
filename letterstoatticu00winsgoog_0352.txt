LETTERS TO ATTICUS IV. 19

your and my Quintus with honours and. dignities and
favours! Just as though Ι were a commanderin-

chief. The choice of any of the army winter-quarters
has just been given him, as Quintus writes me. If
one does not fall in love with such a man, which of
the others could one fall in love with?

By the bye, had I told you I am on Pompey’s staff,
and from the 13th of January shall not be in Rome?
It seemed to meto square with a good many things.
I need not say more. I think Ι will leave the rest
till we meet to give you something to look forward
to. My best respeets to Dionysius. Ι have not
merely kept a place for him; I have built one. In
fact his coming will add a finishing stroke to the
great joy I shall find in your return. The day you
arrive, I must insist on you and your company stay·

, ing with me.
