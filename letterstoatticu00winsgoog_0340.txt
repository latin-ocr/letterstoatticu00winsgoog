LETTERS TO ATTICUS IV. 17

’ them OpimuS, Veiento, and Bantius-have appealed
to the tribunes to prevent their being called upon to
serve without the sanction of the people. The affair is
going on. A senatorial decree postponed the elec-
tions until an enactment about the trial with closed
doors was carried. Τὴε day for that enactment came,
and Terentius vetoed it. The consuls, who were
taking the matter very coolly, referred the point to
the Senate. Thereupon there was Bedlam, and 1

Senate had passed a decree that the electioris should
not be held before that enactment was passed: if it

the matter was referred to the Senate: and they
decided that it was to the interest of the State that
the elections should be held as soon as possible.
Scaurus, who was acquitted in the last few days,
after a most elaborate speech from me in his defence,
gave the requisite donations to the people tribe by

last of September, on which I am writing, had been
rendered impossible for the electioris by ill omens
announced by Scaevola. But though his liberality
exceeded theirs, those who came first won the most

popularity. Ι should like to see your face as you read
’ this. For of course you have no hope that the busi-
=' ness will be protracted over many weeks. But there
is going to be a meeting of the Senate on the first
of October, to-day‚ for the day is already breaking.
