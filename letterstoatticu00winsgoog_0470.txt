LETTERS TO ATTICUS VI. 2
company of foot? He is beginning to live in spend-

³ christ style. The leading people of Salamis insist,

he declares. Of course3 that is why they came to me
and with tears told me of his men’s atrocities and
their own miseries. Accordinglyl sent a letter at
once ordering the cavalry to quit Cyprus by a certain

, day, and that, as well as other acts of mine, has

caused the people of Salamis to praise me to the

¹ skies in their decrees There is no need of cavalry

now, for the people are ready to pay,-unless perhaps
1 want to use force to make them pay 48 per cent
interest. Were Ι to do such a thing, Ι could never
venture to read or touch those volumes which you
praise. You, my dear fellow, have had far too much
regard for Brutus iu the matter. Ι perhaps not
enough. Ι have informed Brutus of the drist of
’ your letter. Now for the remaining topics.

Ι am pleased to do all Ι can for Appius here con·

l sistently with my honour. 1 do not dislike him audI
like Brutus: and Pompey, for whom l have a higher

regard every day, is surprisingly importuuate. You
have heard that C. Caelius comes here as quaestor.
Ι don't know why, but Idon't like that affair of

Ι Pammenes. I hope to be at Athens in the mouth of

September. Please let me know the dates of your
travels. Ι understood the naioeie of Sempronius
Rufus from your letter written in Corcyra. Ι am
’ really quite jealous of the influence of Vestorius.

Ι should like to keep on chatting, but day dawns,

Ἰ the crowd is pressing iu and Philogenes isin a hurry.

Good-bye, give my greetings to Pilia, when you
’ write, and to your daughter: and accept greetings
from my sou.
