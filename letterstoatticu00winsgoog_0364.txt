LETTERS TO ATTICUS V. 4

hope. As regards the man you mention, I am slip-
ping into your vien, not that-— but for want of a
better we are compelled to be satisfied with him.
As for the other man who, you say, appears a not
unlikely candidate, l fear my daughter could not be
persuaded, and, as you add, there is not a pin to

, choose between them. For myselfl am reasonable;

but you will be away, and will any account be taken

χ of me in my absence? For, if either of us were on
¹ the spot, a good face might be put on the matter

with Servius through theagency of Servilia. Now.
even if it were a thing 1 favoured, I see no way of
bringing it to pass.

Now I come to that letter which I received from
Tullius. You have been very energetic about Mar-
cellus: so, if a deeree should be passed, please inform
me: but, if not, try to carry the matter through: a
grant ought to be made to me and to Bibulus But
Ι am confident that the decree will be passed espe-
cially as it saves the people's pocket. That is line
about Torquatus. As for Maso and Ligur, we can
wait till they come. As to Chaerippus’ request, since
you have given me no tip on the matter— hang
the province! Must Ι trouble about him too? well,
Ι must take enough trouble to prevent any debate on
the matter or count out in the House. As for

ι others— however you do well to have spoken

with Scrofa. As to Pomptinus you are right. lt
comes to this, if Pomptinus will be at Brundisium

¹ before June, M. Anneius and L. Tullius need not

hurry out of Rome. As to your news from SiciniuS,

Ι am satisfied, provided this restriction does not apply

to auyone who has obliged me. But Ι will think it

over, as the plan pleases me. Ι will let you know
