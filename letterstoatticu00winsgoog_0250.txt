LETTERS TO ATTlCUS 111. 15-16

others. It is my own folly in thinking that your affec·
tion for me was as grean as I wished it to be, that Ι am
finding fault with. If it had been so, you would not
have shown more loyalty, but you would have taken
more trouble, and you would certainly have prevented
me from rushing to my fate, and would not haic had
all the trouble you are now taking to repair the ship-
wreck. So plesse let me know all that you can
ascertain for certain, and continue to wish to see me
a somebody again, even if I cannot regain the posi-
tion Ι once held and might have held. Ι hope you
won’t think it is you and not myself Ι am blaming in
this letter. If there is anyone to whom you think a ’
letter ought to be sent in my name, please write one
and see that it is sent. ’

crosno ro micus, suemus.
Ι am waiting for your letters of the first of August Thessa-
before Ι can decide at all where Ι shall go. ΙΙ there lma, Aug·
is any hope, Ι shall go to Epirus: if'not, Ι shall make 19³ Μ· 53
for Cyzicus, or take some other direction. The more.
y often Ι read your letters, the less hope Ι have: for,
' though they' are cheerful, they tone down any hope
they raise‚ so that one cau easily see that your alle-
giance wavers between consolation of me and truth.
Ι must therefore beg you to report facts just as they
, are, and what you really think of them.
