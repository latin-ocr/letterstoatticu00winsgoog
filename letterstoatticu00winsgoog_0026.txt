LETTERS TO ATTICUS l. 1-3

even to make new friends. lhope Ι have justified

myself to you. Ι am really anxious to do so.
Α Ι am highly delighted with your Hermathena,

Many thanks for it

ΙΙ beg to inform you that on the very day that Rome,
L. Julius Caesar and C. Marcius Figulus were elected shortly ofler
to the consulship 1 was blessed with a babyboy31ctter1, nc.
and Terentia is doing well. lt is ages since I had a 65
Ι letter from you! I have written before and told you
all my affairs. At the present minute I am think·
* ing about defending my fellow candidate Catiline.
3' We can have any jury we like with the greatest
r good will of the prosecutor. Ι hope, if Catiline is
χ acquitted‚ it will make us better friends in our can·
vassing: but, if it does not, Ι shall take it quietly. ‚
Ι badly want you back soon: for there is a wide·
³ spread opinion that some friends of yours among the
l upper ten are opposed to my election, and Ι can see
ζ that you will be of the greatest assistance to mein

winning their good will. ,So be sure you come back
to town in January, as you proposed.
