LETTERS TO ATTICUS Il. 3

Now l come 10 J anuary and my political attitude;

01111 l shall follow the fashion 01 the Socratic schools
1 in giving both sides 01 the question, ending, however,

as they do, with the one which l prefer. lt really is a
point that requires much consideration. For either l
have got to resist the agrarian measure strongly, which
would mean something 01 a fight, though l should gain ’
prestige by it; or I must hold my peace, which is equiv-
alent to retiring 10 Solonium or Antium ; 01 else l must
assist the measure, and that is what they say Caesar
expects 1110 10 110 beyond a doubt. For Cornelius paid
me 0 visit—I mean Balbus, Caesar's great friend. He ,
assured 1110 that Caesar will take my own and Pompey’s
opinion 011 everything, and that he will make an effort
to reconcile Pompey and Crassus. On this side of the
sheet may be placed an intimate connection with Pom·
pey and, if Ι like, with Caesar too, reconciliation with
my 0110111100, peace with the populac'e, and ease in my
old age. But my blood is still stirred by the finale I
laid down 101· myself in the 3rd book 01 my poem :¹

“Meantime the course you chose in youth’s first

sprmg

And held to, 110011 01111 soul, ’mid civic strife

Keep still, with growing fame and good report.’'
Since Calliope herself dictated those verses tome 111
0 book full 01 passages in lordly vein, l ought not to
have the least hesitation in holding “ 110 0111011, better Iliad xii, 243
than to right one's country's wrongs.”

But 11110 point must be reserved for our strolls at
the Compitalia. Do you remember the day before
the festival. Ι will order the bath to be heated, and

Terentia is goingto invite Pomponia. We will make .

ι 'On his consulship.
