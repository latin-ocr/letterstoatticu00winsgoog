INTRODUCTION3 · · .
Tnn letters contained in this volume cover a large
and important period in Cicero’s life and in the
history oi Rome. They begin when he was 88 years
·of age3and at first they are notvery numerous. There
are only two of thet year (68 ne), six of the following
year, one of the year 66, when he held the praetor-
ship, and two oi 65. Then there is s gap in his corre-
spondence. No letters at all survive from the period
of his consulship ond the Catilinarian conspiracy3
and the letters to Atticus do not begin again until
two years after that event. Thereafter they ere
sufficiently frequent to justify Cornelius N epos' criti-
cism, that reading them, one has little need of an
'elaborate history oi the period. There are full-
almost too full-details, considering the frequent
complaints and repetitions, during the year of his
banishment (58457 ne), and the correspondence
continues unbroken to the year 54. Then aiter a
lapse of two years or more, which Atticus presum-
ably spent in Rome, it begins again in‘ 51, when
ἐ Cicero was sent to Cilicia as pro-consul, much against
-his will; and the volume ends with a hint of the
trouble that was brewing between Caesar and
1 Pompey, os Cicero was returning to Rome towards

³ the end of the next year.
