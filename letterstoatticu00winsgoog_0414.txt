LETTERS TO ATTICUS V. 20

the letter which you say was entrusted to the slaves
of Laenius. It was glad tidings that you wrote me
about Caesar and the decree of the House and your
own hopes. If Caesar falls in with this, Ι shall bej
’ safe from any extension of office. Ι am not much
concerned that Seius was singed in Plaetorius' iire¹
' Ι want to know why Lucceius was so keen about Q.
Cassius and what has happened.

Ι am commissioned to celebrate the coming of age

of Quintus, your sister's son, on arrival at Laodicea. y f

, Ishall keep a careful hold upon him. Deiotarus ’

who has been of great help to me, has written that . . .
he will come to me at Laodicea with the two boys* ’ ’

Iam awaiting another letter from you from Epirus,
that Ι may have an account not only of your work-a-
day life, but of your holiday life. Nicanor is doing his
ζ duty by me, and is being well treated. l think 1
2 shall send him to Rome with my official despatch‚
that it may be promptly delivered and at the same
. time that he may bring me certain news about you
and from you. Ι am pleased that Alexis so often
Ῑ sends greetings to me3 but why cannot he put them
in a letter of his own, as Tiro, who is my Alexis, does
for you. Ι am searching for a horn for Phemius.²
l But enough now. Keep your health and let me
. know when you intend to go to town. Good-bye,
again good-bye.
’ Ι have been at pains to recommend your interests
and your people to Thermus, both personally at
Ephesus and now by letter, and l have gothered'that
he is very solicitous on yourbehalf. Please execute
