: A sea voyage is a big business, especially in the At rea,
η month of July. six days aster leaving Athens IJuly,
cameto Delos On the 6th of July Ι got from the ne. 51
Piraeus to Zoster with a contrary wind which kept
us there on the 7th. On the 8th we reached Ceos
in fine weather. From there we cameto GyaroS, with
a wind strong, but not contrary: thence to Syros, and
from Syros to Delos; in both cases sailing quicker
than we could have wished. You know by this ·
time what the open boats of Rhodes are like, poor
things in a rough sea. So Ι have made up my mind
not to hur-ry and not to stir hom Delos until I'· see
“all the peaks of Gyrae” clear. ‘

Ι sent you a letter about Messalla at once from ·
Gyaros assoon as Ι heard, and another on my own
initiative to Hortensius, for Ι felt much sympathy
with him. Ι await a letter from you to give me the
gossip about the verdict and about the political
situation, dealing, if Ι may say so, more with public
topicS, since now, with the aid of Thallumetus, you
are running through my books. I don't want a letter
to tell me what is actually happening,for that tire-
some fellow your client Helonius can do that: but I
want to know what is likely to happen.
