CICERO’S LETTERS
TO ATTlCUS
BOOK lv

ἱ CICERO ΤΟ mione, ensurius.

As soon as Ι reached Rome and there was anyone Rome, Sept,
ito whom Ι could safely entrust a letter to you, myumc 57
first thought was to write and thank you for my
ι return, since you ave not here to receive my thanks.
For I grasped, to tell you the truth, thar though in ·
¹ the advice you gave me you showed yourself no wiser
and no braver than myself, ahd indeed, considering
my past attentioris to you, you were none too energetic
in defence of my honour, still, though at first you
shared my mistake or rather my madness and my
unnecessary fright, it was you who took my exile most
to beart and contributed most energy, zeal and perse·
, vevance in bringing about my return. And so Ι can
2 assure you thatin the midst of great rejoicing and
the most gratifying congratulations, one thing was
lacking to fill the cup of my happiness, the sight of
you or rather your embrace. When once Ι have
obtained that, Ι shall certainly think myself·unde-²
serving of this renewal of good fortune, if ever Ι
· let you go again, and if Ι do not exact to the full all
arrears in the enjoyment of your pleasant society..
As regards my politica] position, Ι have attained
what Ι thought would be the hardest thing to recover
= ⁸-my distinction at the, Bar, my authority in the
House and more popularity with the sound party
than Ι desire. But you know how my private pro-
perty has been crippled, dissipated, plundered. Ι
