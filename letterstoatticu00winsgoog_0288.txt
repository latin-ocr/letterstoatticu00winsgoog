LETTERS TO ATTICUS iv. 2

consent the xconcession was unwillingly made. On
the next day the decree which 1 send was passed.
Tben the consuls gave out the contractior the
restoration os the portico os Catulus; and the con·
tractors immediately pulled down that portico of his
to everybody’s satisfaction. The consuls valued my
house at nearly εξ318,0001 at their assessor's advice:
and the other things very stingily-my Tusculan villa
at samo and my Formran at arnoul Thisesumate
was violently decried not only by all the conservative
party, but by the people too. If you ask me the >
reason, they say it was my bashfulness, as' 1 did not
refuse or make pressing demands. But that is not
the reason ; for that in itsels would have counted for
me. But the fact is, my dear Pomponius, those very
same men-you know quite well whol mean-who

κ cut my wings, do not wish them to grow again. But

Ι hope they are growing. Do you only come tome.

But l· sear you may be delayed by the visit of your '

and my friend Varro.

be appointed legate to Pompey with a reservation
that it should not hamper me at all. ΙΙ Ι did not
want to have a free hand to stand for the censorship,
if the next consuls hold a censorial election, Ι would
have taken a votive commission³ to nearly any shrines
or groves. For that was what suited my idea of my
interests best' But Ι wanted to be free either to
stand for election or to quit the city at the beginning
of summer and meanwhile l thought it good policy
