temnus To Arrrcus 111. 15

should have been, Ι will be so persistent with them,
that you shall feel that Ι have been restored to you
quite as much as to my brother and children. If ever
l have wronged you or rather for the wrongs that Ι

’ have doneyou, forgive me. lhave wronged myself

far more deeply. Ι do not write this in ignorance
of your great grief at my misfortune, but because, if
Ι had earned a right to all the affection you lavish
and have lavished on me, you would never have
suffered me to stand in need of that sound common
sense of yourS, and you would not have let me be
persuaded that it was to my interest to let the bill
about the guilds¹ be passed. But you, like myself,
only gave your tears to my distress, as a tribute of
affection: and it was my fault, not yourS, that you did
not devote day and night to pondering on the course

Ι should take, as you might have done, if my claims ’

on you had been stronger. If you or anyone had
dissuaded me from the disgraceful resolve Ι formed
in my alarm at Pompey’s ungenerous reply,—and
you were the person best qualified to do so—I should
either have died with honour, or should to-day be
living in triumph. You will pardon what Ι have
said. Ι am blaming myself far more than you, and
you only as my second self, and, because Ι want a
companion in my guilt If l am restored, our com-

’ mon guilt will seem far less, and you, at any rate,
will hold me dear for services rendered, not received,
by you.

¹The collegia were guilds for social, mercantile, or reli·
gious purposes. Α deeree had declared some of them illegal
in 64 13.c.; but this was counteracted by a bill passed by
Clodius in 58 mc. The result was many new guilds were
formed, which he used for political purposes.
