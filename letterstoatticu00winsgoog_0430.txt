LETTERS TO ATTICUS V. 21
, Rome, l think) in the matter of money-lenders, that

12 per cent simple interest shall be the rate. The
’ difference between the two totals you will already
have arrived at, if I do not belie your skill0as a
ready-reckoner. Apropor of this, by the way, L. Ι
Lucceius, son of Marcus, writes me a petulant letter
ι that there is great danger of a general repudiation of
debts resulting from these decrees. He recalls the
harm that C. Julius did once when he allowed a little
postponement of the day of payment: public credit ·
’ never received a worse blow. But to return to my
point. Think over my case against brutus, if it is a.
case, when there are no fair arguments on the other
side, especially as l have left the matter as it stood.

To wind up with family matters. As to my houdoir
business, I agree with you in preferring Postumia’s
son,1 since Pontidia is playing the fool. ButI wish you
'were there. You must expect no letters from Quin-
tus at this season. The snows prevent passage of the
l Taurus until June. Iam supporting Thermus, as you
request, by frequent letters. As for P. Valerius,
Deiotarus says that he has nothing and is his pen-
* sioner. When you know whether there are to be
7 additions to the calendar at Rome or not, please
write me positive news as to the date of the Mys-
teries. I look forward to your letters rather less
eagerly than if you were in town3 still l do look
forward to them.

¹ Servius Sulpicius, as a husband sor Tullia.
