LETTERS'TO ATTICUS V. 18

. Pacorus, a son of the Parthian king Orodes, with
ᾗ nearly all their forces. There is no news of the
presence of Bibulus in Syria: Cassius is in the town
of Antioch with his wholearmy. I am in Cappadocia

near the Taurus with my army close to Cybistra. The

' enemy is in Cyrrhestica, a district of Syria adjoining

my province. Ι have sent a despatch to the Senate
on the situation. If you are in Rome, please look at
the despatch and say whether you think it ought to
be delivered: and so for my other affairs, chief of
which -is lest there be, as the saying goeS, any slip
between the cup andthe lip,l Ι mean that l may not

, be burdenedwithanextension of office. Considering
1 the weakness of my army, my want of allies, especially

faithful allies, my most sure support is the winter

. weather. lf winter comes and the enemy have not

first crossed into my province, Ι am afraid the Senate
may refuse to let Pompey leave Rome owing to fear of
disturbance at home. But if it sends some one else

1 by spring, 1 don't care, provided that there be no
' extension of my term of office. Those are my com-

missione, if you are in'town. lf you are out of town,
<or even if you are not, the situation is this. Ι amin
’ excellent spirits; and Ι hope, as my plans are well laid,

. that Ι am not too sanguine about my preparations.

*I have pitched c'amp in a safe spot, well supplied on
the score of corn, almost within sight of Cilicia, con·
venient for change of quarters, with an army small
but, I hope, very loyal to me, which will be doubled
by the arrival of Deiotarus with all his forces.
Ι have found our allies far more loyal than any of my
predecessors have found them. They cannot under-

stand my mildness and self-abnegation. A levy is
¹ Lit. “Between the slayingand the offeringof the victim.''
