LETTERS ΤΟ ATTICUS Vl. 9

‘and you thought that it was nothing serious and that

he had gathered as much from your people. This
view seemed to be supported by a remark at the end

pleased at' your writing to me in your o'wn hand un-
der the circumstances So 1 will say no more. For·
Ι hope considering your careful and temperate life—
and to be sure Acastus bids me bc confident-that

· you are now as well as Ι could wisb.

Ι am glad you got my letter from Turranius, Keep

³ same vision came to us both, as though we had talked

it over. There was nothing else to be done, and your
long doubt has relieved me of hesitation. But Ι
fancy you must have already got a letter on this
topic written in more detail.
