‘what an assistance to me is your promise to devote
all your resources to my restoration, that 1 need not
call on anyone else for help. I know too that you
are taking on your shoulders several men’s burdens
on my behalf, and that you are quite capable of
bearing them, and will not require asking todo so.
You forbid me to imagine that it has ever entered
your head that Ι have done what I ought not or left
undone what Ι ought to have done in my dealings
with you—well, Ι will humour you and free my heart
from that anxiety, but Ι shall count myself still deeper
in your debt, because your kindness to me has far
exceeded mine to you. Please send me news of
everything you see or gather and of all that isbeing
done 3 ,and urge all your friends to support my return.
Sestius' bill does not pay sufficient regard to dignity]
or cautiori. ΤΙῑε proposal should mention me by ν
name, and contain a carefully worded clause about
my property. Please pay attention to that point.

It is just thirty days from the date of this letter Theneb- ’

, since Ι had any news from you. My intentioris are, nico, oetas,
Ὗ as Ι have said before, to go to Epirus, and to await nc. 58 .

my fate there rather than anywhere else. Ι must beg

you to inform me quite openly of anything you notice,

whether for good or for bad, and, as you suggest, to

send letters in my name to every one to whom you
y think it necessary.
