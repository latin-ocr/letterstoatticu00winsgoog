LETTERS TO ATTICUS Il. 1

so Ι have no chance of enjoying your society and
you lack mine. Just at present things are peaceful: ¹
but if that little beauty1 should be strong enough to*
indulge in any wilder freaks Ι should certainly be
routing you out of your retreat. However, Metellus
is holding him in nobly and will continue 'to do so.
Most assuredly he is a thoroughly patriotic consul,
and, as Ι always thought, an excellent fellow. Clodiu
does not beat about the bush, he is quite plainly aim
ing at the tribunate. When the point was discusse
in the Senate, Ι sat on him, accusing him of incon
sistency, for seeking the tribunate now 'in Rome, “
when in Sicily he did nothing but repeat that what=
he wanted was an inheritance. However, Ι added, ·
- we need not put ourselves about on that point, as
he would not be allowed to ruin the country if he
becomes a plebeian any more than patricians of his·
kidney were allowed to in my consulship. Then,
when he said he had come from the straits in a'
week, so that no one could go to meet him, 'and had
entered the city at night, and boasted of the fact in
a public speech, Ι said there was nothing new in that.
“Seven days from Sicily to Rome: the other time
three hours from Rome to Interamna He came in at
night: so he did before. No one met him now: nor
did anyone meet him last time, when they certainly ,
ought to have done so.’' In fact, I am taking th

cheek out of him, not only by serious set speeches ·

but by quips of this kind too. So nowadays 1 band

jests and banter with him quite familiarly. For in-
stance, when we were escorting a candidate, he asked
me whether Ι used to give the Sicilians seats at the

gladiatorial shows. Isaid,“No.’' “Well,’' said he,
