ξ want to go to Rhodes for the sake of the boyS, thence
as soon as possible to Athens, though the Etesian

³ during the magistracy of men whose good-will Ι
experienced over that thanksgiving in my honour,
ἵ However please send a letter to meet me, saying if

you think there can be any political reason for delay.
