LETTERS TO ATTICUS 'V. 21

This makes me fear that the Senate may pay no
’ respect to Caesar's demands, refusing to let Pompey
quit Rome, when revolution is imminent. Until
this trouble is unravelled, it may decline to allow me
to leave the province before my successor command
Ἰ not be willing to entrust such important provinces in
’ troublous times to legates. So Ι shudder to think
that the term of my office may be extended without
even any tribune being able to veto it ; and the more
so on account of your absence, when you might inter·
fere in many cases with your advice, influence and
efforts. You will say Ι am raising imaginary alarms Ι
5 am forced to hope that my alarms may be idle, but
Ι everything frightens me. Though your letter written
, at Buthrotum in sickness had a charming finale, “As
Ι see and hope, there will be nothing to hinder your

departure,'’stilllsh0uld prefer the 'phrase “as Isee‘’ ι

3 and there was no need for the words “and hope.” Ι
have received a letter dated just after the triumph of
= Lentulus,which was brought post haste to Iconium by
the tax-fanners' messengers. In it you repeat that
bitter-sweet saying, that there will be no delay, with
, a postscript, that, if anything goes wrong, you your-
l ’ self will come to me. Iam tortured by the doubts
you express: and you may see which of your letters I
have received, for I have not got the letter which you
say was handed to Hermo the centurion's orderly. You
have repeatedly told me you entrusted a letter to
the slaves of Laenius. That letter, which was dated
the 21st of September, was handed to me at last by
Laenius on my arrival at Laodicea on the llth of
i February. Iwill show Laenius at once in word and
’ in the future in deed that your recommendation
carries weight. Resides old topics the letter hed
