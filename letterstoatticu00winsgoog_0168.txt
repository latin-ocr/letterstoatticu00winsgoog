LETTERS TO ATTICUS ΙΙ. 15

the position of affairs at all. Upon my word our
only hope rests in Publius. Let him by all means
become tribune3 if for no other reason, to makell
you return all the sooner from Epirus. For Ι don't
see how you can possibly keep away from him,
especially if he should choose to quarrel with me.
But of course Ι have no doubt that you would lly to
my side, if anything of the kind were to happen. But,
evenis this does not happen, Ι am looking forward
to a sight worth seeing, whether he runs amuck or
saves the state, if Ι can watch it with you sitting by
my side.

Just as Ι was writing these words, in comes Se-
bosus: and Ι had hardly fetched a sigh, when there
was Anius saying “Good day.'’ This is going out
of town! Is it escaping from society to run into
people like this? 'I shall certainly be off to “My'
native hills, the cradle of my youth.'’ To put it
shortly, if Ι can't be alone, Ι would rather be with
i countryfolk than with these ultra-city men. How-
ever, 'as you send no definite date, Ι will wait for you
at Formiae till the 5th of May.

Terentia is much gratified by the attention and
care you have bestowed on her dispute with Mulvius.
She has not the least idea that you are supporting
the common cause of all the owners of public land.
However you do pay something to the tax-collectors3
while she refuses to pay a penny. Accordingly she
3 and my boy, a most conservative lad, send their

respects. ·
