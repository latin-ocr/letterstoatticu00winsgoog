LETTERS TO ATTICUS ΙΙΙ. 9

= truth and it will show you the depth of my misery—
Icould not bear in nly great distress to look on one·
so devoted to me and so tendet-hearted, nor could Ι ³
thrust upon him the misery of my affliction and my
fallen fortune, or suffer him 'to see me. Besides Ι
was afraid of what would have been sure to happen.
—that he, would not be able to part from me. The
picture of the moment when he would have had to ⁵
dismiss his lictors or to be torn by force from my arms .
was ever before me. The bitterness of parting 1 have
avoided by the bitterness of not seeing my brother.
That is the kind of dilemma into which you who are
responsible for my survival have forced 'me; and so
Ι have 'to pay the penalty for my mistake. Your
letter however cheers me, though Ι can easily see
from it how little hope you have yourself. Still. it
offered some little consolation till you passed frorn
your mention of Pompey to the passage: “Now
try- to win over Hortensius and such people.’.' In
heaven’s name, my dear Pomponius, have you not
yet grasped, whose agency, whose villainy and whose
treachery have ruined me? But that Ι will dis-
cuss when Ι meet you. Now Ι will only say, what
you must surely know, that it is not so much my
enemies as my enviers who have ruined me. If
th'ere is any real foundation for your hopes, Ι will
«bear up and rely on the hope you suggest. But if,
as 'seems probable to me, your hopes are ill-founded,
then Ι will do now what you would not let me do
before, though the time is far less appropriate.
Terentia often expresses her gratitude to you.
The thing Ι most fear among all my missortunes is
=my poor brother’s business ε if Ι knew the exact state
of affairs, Ι might know what to do about it. Ι arn
