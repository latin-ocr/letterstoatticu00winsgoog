LETTERS TO ATTICUS 1. 19·20

V you to anyone. But that is a point we have-to dis-
cuss very carefully when we meet, if only you will
come and see me some time. This CossiniuS, to whom
Ι have given the letter, seems to me a very good

you described him in your letter. March 15.

to experience such courtesy and forbearance from
you or any other man. So I think it would be

f when we meet.
³ Your remarks about politics are couched in friendly
and prudent termS, and your view does not differ
from my own—for 1 must not withdraw from my dig-
nified position, nor must Ι enter another's lines with-
out any forces of my own, and the man you mention
has'no ‘broad-mindedness and no high-mindedness,
