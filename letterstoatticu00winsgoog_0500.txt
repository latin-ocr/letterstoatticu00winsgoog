LETTERS TO ATTICUS Vl. 9

l mean to send letter-carriers to you to-morrow,
who l fancy will arrive. before our friend Saufeius:
but it was hardly proper that he should come to you
without a letter from me. Please write me fully, as
you promise, about my little daughter, that is about
her husband Dolabella, about the political situation

in which l foresee much trouble, about the censors,
and above all about the business of statues and
pictures, and whether the matter will come up before
the Senate.ยน The 15th of October is the date of this
letter, a day on which you say Caesaris going to bring
four legions to Placentia. l wonder what will be
our fate. My present quarters on the Acropolis at
Athens seem to me the best place.

ยน The censors had fixed a limit on private expenditure on
works of art: but their edict required the confirmation of
the Senate before it became law.
