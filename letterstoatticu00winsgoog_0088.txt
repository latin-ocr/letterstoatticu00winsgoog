regards'affection to myself, aster my brother and my

⁴ ' immediate connections, Ι give you the palm. Forl
² , have seen time aiter time, and have had thorough ex-

perience of your sorrow and your joy in my changiug
fortunes. Ι have osten had the pleasure of your con-
gratulations in times of triumph and the comfort of
your consolation in hours of despondency. Nay at
this very moment your absence makes me feel the
lack not only of your advice, which you excel in
giving, but of the interchange of speech, which Ι
enjoy most with you. 1 hardly know if Ι miss it
most in politics, where Ι dare not make a slip; or in
my legal work, which 1 used to undertake for ad-
vancement's'sake and now keep up to preserve my
position„ through popularity; or in my private con-
cems. In all of them Ι have felt your loss all along
’ and especially since my brother’s departure. Finally,
neither my work nor my recreation, neither my
business nor my leisure, neither my legal affairs nor
ι my domestic, my public life or my private, can do
without your most agreeable and affectionate advice
and conversation any longer. ¹

The modesty of both of us has osten prevented
me from mentioning these facts: but now it was
forced upon me by that part of your letter in which
you say you want yourself and your character cleared

and vindicated in my eyes There is one good thing ’

as regards the unpleasantness caused by his aliena-
tion and anger, that your determination not to go tb
the province was known to me and other friends of
» yours, as you told us some time before; so the ‘fact
that you are not with him cannot be attributed to
your quarrel and rupture, but to your choice and
plans already fixed. So amends will be made for
