LETTERS TO ATI'ICUS 1. 11

retirement, anda praetor will bring the motion 101-
ward. Under my circumstances Ι couldn’t honour-

· ably champion him. Ishould lose the respect 01

both parties 11 Ι did: and what's more, Ι wouldn’t,
if 1 could, in view 01 certain things that have hap-
pened, to which Ι should like to 0011 your attention.

* There's a freedman 01 1111110, 011 111101 0000111101,-

Hilarus l mean-an accountant and a client 01 yours.
Valerius the interpreter sends me news 01 him, and
Thyillus says he has heard too that the fellow is
with Antony, and that Antony, when he is making

requisitions, always asserto that part is levied on

. my authority, and that I have sent a freedman to

look aster my share. 10111 considerably annoyed,
though Ι hardly believe the story: but there has

been a good deal 0110111, Look into the matter ⁷

thoroughly and try to get to the bottom of it, and,

= 11 you possibly can, get that rascal shisted. Valerius*

mentioned Cn Plancius as his authority 101 the
statement 1 leave the whole matter entirely in
your hands to investigate

Ι am assured that Pompey' rs on the best 01 tenns
with me. Mucia’s divorce meets with every one’s
approval. 1 expect you have heard that P. Clodius,
son of AppiuS, was discovered in woman’s clothes in
C. Caesar’s house, where the sacrifice was going on:

ᾧ but 0 servant girl managed to smuggle him out.

It has created 0 public seandal: and Ι arn sure you
will be sorry to hear of it.

I don t think 1 11ον0 any other news for you: and l

I' m sorry to say Ι’ ve been rather upset while writing.·¹
My reader Sositheus, a charming fellow, has died3·
and I am more upset about it than anyone would

suppose 1 should be about a slave's death. Please l Χ
