LETTERS TO ATTlCUS VI. 2

, Scaptius is sorry. As to his argument from a decree

of the Senate ordering judgement to be given ac-
cording to the bond, the reason for that was that in
borrowing the money the people of Salamis contra-

, vened the law of Gabinius. Aulus’ law forbade that

judgement should be given for money so borrowed.
So the Senate decreed that judgement might be

, given on that particular bond. Now the bond in

done indescribable damage in such a weak island.
Do you say, they would have refrained? Look at

Ἴ the damage they did before Ι came here. They

kept the members of the local Senate prisoners in
their Chamber for so long that some died of hunger.
For Scaptius was a prefect of Appius, and was allowed
some cavalry. Your face is always before my eyeS,

ο when Ι think of duty and honour, and can you, you,

Ι repeat, ask me to give the fellow the office of pre·
fect? I had settled in other cases neverto give the office
to a man of business, a course which had won the ap-
proval of Brutus: and is a fellow like Scaptius to

have cavalry? Why should he not be content with a
