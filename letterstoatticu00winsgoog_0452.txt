LETTERS TO ATTICUS Vl. l

was never censor? Certainly the statue which has
lately been placed on high near the temple of Ops
1 has only the inscription cos. But the statue near the
Hercules of Polycles bears the inscription caua: and
the pose, the dress, the ring and the likeness prove
’ that it is a statue of the same person. As a matter
of fact, when among the crowd of gilded knights
placed by Metellus on the Capitol, Ι noticed a like-
ness of Africanus with the name Serapio on the

pedestal, Ι thought it was a workman’s error, but ’

now Ι see it is Metellus’ mistake. What gross igno-
rance of history! For that misconception about
Flavius and the calendar, if it is such, is widely held:
and you were quite right in having doubts about it.
Ι have followed the view which is almost universal, as
Greek authors often do. Every one says that Eupolis,
the poet of the old Comedy, was thrown into the sea
, by Alcibiades on his voyage to Sicily. Eratosthenes
confutes this, producing plays exhibited by him
aster that date. But that is no reason for laughing
at Duris of Samos, who is an accurate historiam
because he follows a vulgar error. All historians
agree that Zaleucus drew up laws for the Locrians.
It is not therefore fatal to Theophrastus, if he is
· called to account for that by your friend Timaeus.
But not to know that one's great-grandfather was not
censor is shocking‚ especially as after his consulship
no Cornelius was censor during his lifetime.

As for your remarks about Philotimus and the pay-
ment of 3182,000,1 Ι hear that Philotimus came to
the Chersonese about the beginning of January, but so
far Ι have heard nothing from him. Camillus writes

that‘he has received my balance. ldon’t know how
