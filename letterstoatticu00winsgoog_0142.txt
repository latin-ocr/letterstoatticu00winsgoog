LETTERS TO ATTICUS ΙΙ. 5-6 ’
glory, Ι am thinking of confining my attention ex·

clusively to the Muses. For all that you must post
me up in news of Curtius and who will succeed to

³ his position, and what is happening about P. Clodius.

general, as you promise. Please let me know on
what day you are leaving Rome, so that Ι can tell
you where Ι shall be: and let me have a letter ut

Ι am not so certain now ⁴about fullilling the Antium,
promises Ι made iu former letters to produce some April,
work in this tour: for Ι have fallen so in love uc, 59
with idlenesS‚ that I can’t tear myself from it. So
Ι either enjoy myself with my books, of which Ι have

tunities for flowers of fancy as Ι imagined: besides-
and this is the chief point-I lind any excuse for

¹ idleness good enough. lam even debating settling
down at Antium, and spending the rest of my life

here : and Ι rea'llywish Ι had been a magistrate here
