LETTERS TO ATTICUS ΙΙ. 17

XVII

crcsno ro urricus, crumino.

Ι agree entirely with what you say in your letter. F omnine,
The Pasha is running amuck. We may anticipate May, ne. 59
anything: he is quite clearly setting upa tyranny.
What else is the meaning ol this sudden marriage-
contraot,1 of the proposals about the Campanian land,
of this reekless expenditure of money? If that were
the end of it, it would be disastrous enough: but the
nature of the case makes it impossible that this
should be the end.¹ These things in themselves can-
not possibly give them any pleasure: and they would
never have taken this step except as the first to other
pernicious acts. But, as you say, we will discuss
these questions rationally at Arpinum about the loth

ξ of May, and not prove all the labour and the mid-

ἶ night oil we have spent on our studies wasted by
weeping over them. Heaven help us! I derive
consolation not so much from hope, as l did formerly,
as from a spirit of indifference, which I call to my
service especially in civic and political matters. Nay
more, the little strain of vanity and thirst for fame
that there is in me—it is a good thing to recognize ¹
one's own faults—even experieuces a pleasurable
sensation. For the thought that the Pasha’s services
to the country might in the dim future be reckoned
higher than mine, used to priek me to the heart:
but now I rest quite easy on that seore. He has
fallen so low that the fallen Curius in comparison
seems to stand erect. But of this when we meet.

It seems now as though you will be at Rome when I

arrive: for which I shall not be at all sorry, if it is
¹Of Pompey with Caesar-'s daughter.
