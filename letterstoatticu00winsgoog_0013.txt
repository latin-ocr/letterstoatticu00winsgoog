been used; but it has been revised by comparison with
more recent works and papers on the subject. Textual
notes have only been given in a few cases where the
reading is especially corrupt or uncertain; and other
notes too bave been confined to cases where they seem·
ed absolutely indispensable. For such notes audinthe
translation itself,lmustaclmowledge myiudebtedness
to predecessors, especially to Tyrrell’s iudispensable
edition and Shuckburgh's excellent translation.
There remain two small pomts to which l may
perhaps call attention here in case they should puz-

finds the dates in this volume disagreeing with the
rules and tables generally given in Latin grammars
and taught in schools, he must please to remember
that those rules apply only to the Julian calendar,
which was introduced in 45 ae, and that these
letters were ,written before that date. Before the
alterations introduced by Caesar, March, May, July
and October had 31 days each, February 28, and the

this showsadifference oi two days in all dates which fall
between the Ides and the end of the months Janu-
ary, August and December, and of one day in similar
’ dates in April, June, September and November.v
The second point, whichfrequires explanation, is
the presence of some numerals in the margin of the
textofletters 16 to 19 of Book lV. As Mommsen
pointed out, the' archetype from which the existent
MSS. were copied must have had some of the leaves
containing these letters transposed These ¹were

printed in earlier editions. ln the text Mommsen's
