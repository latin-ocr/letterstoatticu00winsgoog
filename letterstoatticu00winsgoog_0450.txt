Lui'ruus ΤΟ Ai'ricus VI. 1

edict, deals with inheritance, ownership and sale, the
appointment of official receivers, matters where suits
are wont to be brought and settled in accordance
with the terms of an edict. A third head dealing
with the rest of judicial procedure Ι lest unwritten. .
Ι stated that in such matters my deerees would be
based on those of Rome. Ι observo this rule, and so
far satisfy everybody. The Greeks are jubilant at

ἵ having foreign jurors. You may say that the jurors

are wasters: however the Greeks flatter themselves

y that they have got home rulo, and your own jurors
¹ are men ofthe lolty standing of Turpio the ahoe

maker and Vettius the broker.

You ask how I am dealing with tli'e tax-gatherers.
Ι pet them, indulge them, praise and honour them:
and take care they trouble no one. Itis very‘odd that
the rates of interest specified in their bonds were up·
held even by Servilius. My procedure is this. Ι name
a day fairly remote, before which, if the debtors pay
up, Ι lay down that'l shall allow only 12 per cent.

÷ But, if they have not paid, judgement will be accord-
' ing to the bond, Accordingly the Greeks pay their

debts at a fair rate of interest, and the farmers are

Ι gratified, provided they get their fill of compliments

and invitations. In short, they are all so intimate
with me that each man thinks himself my special
favourite. But still you know the old saw.l

As to the statue of Africanus (what a medley of
topics! but that was the delightful feature of your
letter, to my mind), do you really mean that Me·
tellus Scipio does not know his great-grandfather

¹The quotation is incompleta and the ending of it un·

known. Probably it contained advice either against trusting
or humouring people too much.
