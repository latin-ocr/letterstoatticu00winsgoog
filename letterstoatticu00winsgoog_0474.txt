made a mistake over the whole matter. Your sphere
is far preferable. You can depart at pleasure3and per-
haps you have lest already. You can put Thesprotia
and Chaonia1 in charge of anyone you like. Ι have
not yet met my brother to know whether he would
consent, if Ι want him to take it over; nor, should he

are there, please send me a sketch of the political
situation to meet me on my way, that Ι may mould my
conduct upon it and bethink me of the proper spirit
, in which to approach Rome. Itis something not to
arrive as a foreigner and a stranger. There was one

point Ι nearly omitted. As Ι have said often, Ι have
