LETTERS TO ATrlcUs V. 20

blood,1 and other centurions of the same squadron,
and a military tribune, Sex. Lucilius son of T. Gavius

Ι Caepio, who has wealth and position. It was really
ὲ a mortifying reverse and inopportune. Ι was at
ἶ Pindenissus, the most strongly fortified town in
Ι Eleutherocilicia and engaged in war so long as men

can remember. The inhabitants were keen warriors,
thoroughly prepared to withstand a siege. We com-
passed it with a stockade and ditch, with big en-
trenchments, penthouses, a tall tower, a large supply
of artillery and a number of archers. With much toil

and preparation Ι settled the business without loss

of life, though many were wounded. I am keeping
a festive holiday, as also are· my soldiers, to whom l
gave all the spoils except the horses. The captives

were sold on the third day of the festival of Saturn.2 .

At the' time of writing, the sum realized at the auctibn
has reached about 2109900.8 l am giving my army
to my brother Quintus to take into winter quarters
in the more disturbed part of the province, while Ι ’
am returning myself to Laodicea. ·

So much forthat. To recurto old topica. Asforthe
point of your exhortation, which is more important
than anything else about which you are concemed—
that Ι may satisfy even my carping Ligurian critic*-
may Ι die, if conduct could be more fastidious than

’ mine. Iamnotgoingtotalkof continenee,aquality
