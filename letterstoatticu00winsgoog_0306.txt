LETTERS TO ATTICUS lv, 627

my sorrow; for, as it happened, l first read the three

in which you said Lentulus was a little better3 and ·
then, lo and behold, a thunderbolt in the fourth.

Still, as l said, he is out of misery, while we live on

in an Iron Age.¹ .

l have not'forgotten your advice to write that
attack on Hortensius though l have drifted into
other things. But upon my word, Ι jibbed at the
very beginning. Ι look foolish enough for not sub-
mitting to his conduct, outrageous though it was,
from a friend, and, if Ι were to write about it, Ι fear
Ι should enhance my folly by advertising his insult,
while at the same time the sels-restraint which Ι
showed in my actions might not be so apparent in ’
writing, and this way of taking satisfaction might
seem rather weak. But we will see. Be sure you
send me a line as often as you can, and take care you
get from Lucceius the letter l sent asking him to
write my biography. Itis a very pretty bit of writing.
Urge him to be quick about it, and give him my
thanks for his answer undertaking it. Have a look
at my house as olten as possible. Say something to
Vestorius: he is behaving most liberally to me.

crosno ro urricus, ausurum.

Nothing could be more t propos than your letter, Arpinum,
which has relieved me about the dear child Quintus Apr orMay,
very greatly. Chaerippus had come two hours earlier uc. 56
with the wildest tales. As to your news about Apol-
loniuS, confound him! A Greek to go baukrupt and

iamet, according to Kayser, contains an allusion to
Hesiod‘s Iron Age: but others take it as simply ‘⁴ callous.”
