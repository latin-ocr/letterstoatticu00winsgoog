template. Ι have avoided seeing my brother, though
Ι love him and always have loved him better than
myself, for fear that I should see him in his grief
and misery, or that Ι, from whom he had parted
in the height of prosperity, should present myself
to him in ruin and humiliation. Of other things too
hard to bear, 1 will say nothing: my tears prevent
me. And what pray is it that calls for reproof? My
grief, or my sin in not retaining my position,-which
would have been easy enough, if there had not bcen
a conspiracy sor my ruin within my own walls—or
<that Ι should not have lost it without losing life too?
My object in writing thus is to‘call for your ready
sympathy, instead of seeming to deserve your re-
' proaches and reprooss‚ and the reason why Ι write
less than usual is partly that my sorrow prevents me,
and partly that Ι have more reason to expect news
from you than to write to you. When Ι get your
news, Ι will give you a clearer idea of my plans.
Please continue to write fully about things as you
have at present, that no detail may escape mc.
Thessalonica, 17 J une.- ·

At ‘present Ι am kept at Thessalonica by your Thessa-
letter and by some good news which however has baba, June
not the best authority. Besides Ι am waiting for 27, nc. 58
your note, and you expressed your desire that Ι should
stay ⁴here. As soon as Ι receive the note Iam wait-

ing for, Ι will come to you, if the hope, which has
reached me by rumour, is confirmed. If not, Ι will

let you know my movements. Please continue to
