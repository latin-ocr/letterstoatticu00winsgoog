’ LETTERS TO ATTICUS V. “15

You would never believe how sick Ι am of the business
¹ and Ι cannot find sufficient scope for the wide interests
and energy you know Ι possesS, and do nothing
ς noticeable. To think that l hold courtin Laodicea,
while A. Plotius does so at Rome, and that Ι have the
nominal command of two skeleton legions, while
Caesar has a huge army! However, it is not these
advantages Ι miss: it is the world, the Forum, the
city, my home and you. Ι will bear as best l can
a year of office: an extension would kill me, Still

ἔξ may combat that very easily if only you are at
me.

You ask what Ι am doing. Upon my life I am '

³ spending a fortune. lam marvellouslyppleased with
the rule of conductlhave formedzand youhavetaught
me to be so admirably self restrained that l fear Ι may
have to borrow to pay off the money· Ι took from
you. Ι avoid opening the wounds which Appius has
, inflicted on the province: but they are patent and

ξ cannot be hidden. ltravel from Laodicea on th‘e

¹ 3rd of August, the date of this letter, to the camp

’ in Lycaonia. Thence Ι intend to go to TauruS, so

that Ι may settle the matte'r of your slave, if possible,

, by pitched battle with Moeragenes,

“'Tis the ox that bears the load, not l.’' ·

I can endure; but, for heaven’s sake, let it be only
for a year. You must be in town at the proper
time to stir up every member of the House. I dm
marvellously anxious because it'is so long since Ι
have had news: so, as I¹ wrote before, give me
news of political matters as well as other things.

Iwill write more fully. [This letter Ι know] will

, be along time in reaching you: but Ι am givin'g it

to a trusty and intimate friend, C. Andronicus of
375
