LETTERS TO ATrlcUs 11. 24

that Vettius should be committed on his own confes·
sion of having carried a weapon ; and that it should be
high treason to release him. 'lhe'vi'ew most generally
held is that it was a put up job: Vettius was to be

discovered in the forum with a dagger and his slaves
round him with weapona, and then he was to turn
king’s evidence: and it would have come off, if the ⁴

’ Curios 11αά not reported thematter to Pompey. Then=
the senatorial decree was read aloud to an assembly.
On the next day, however, Caesar, the man who as
praetor some years ago had bidden Q. Catulus speak
from the floor, brought Vettius out on the rostra, and
set him in a place which was beyond Bibulus’ aspira·
tion, though a consul. Here he said anything he liked

. about public affairs; and, as he had come ready ,

primed and tutored, he omitted all mention of Cae-
pio, though he 11αά named him most emphatically in
the House: so it was obvious that a night and a noc-
turnal appeal had intervened. Then he mentioned,v
people on whom he had not cast the slightest sus-
picion in the House,-—L. LuculluS, who, he said,
generally used to send to him C. Fannius, the man
who once supported a prosecution of P. Clodius,
and L Domitius, whose house was to be the basis of
operations. My name he did not mention, but he
said that an eloquent err-consul, a neighbour of the
consul, had remarked to him that we stood in need
of a Servilius Ahala or a Brutus. He added at the
end, when he had been called back by Vatinius after
the assembly was dismissed, that he had heard from
Curio that Piso, my son-in·law, was in the plot, and
M. Laterensis too.
