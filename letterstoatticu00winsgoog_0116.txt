LETTERS TO ATTICUS Ι. 20

Cincian law¹, Ι said Ι would very willingly accept, ii
he brought them here. Now, as you love me, as you
know Ι love you, stir up all your friendS, clients,
guests, freedmen, nay even your slaves, to see that
not a leaf is lost. For Ι have urgent necessity for
the Greek works, which Ι suspect, and the Latin
books, which Ι arn sure, he left. Every day Ι seek
my recreation, in such time as is leit me from my
legal labourS, more and more in such studies. You
will do me the greatest of favours, if you will show
the same zeal in this as you generally do in matters
about which you think Ι am really keen. Paetus'
own affairs l recommend to your notice too, and he
expresses his deepest gratitude. And l do more than
ask you, Ι urge you, to pay me a visit soon.
