tumus TO ATTICUS VI. 4

in charge. The quaestor Mescinius is by no ‚means
asuitable person. Of Caelius Ι hear nothing. The
proper thing seems to be to leave my brother with
military power, but that involves many difficulties

serves our purpose little.

You, having corne safe to Rome, as I hope, will as
usual look to everything that concerns me, especially
the matter of my daughter, about whose marriage
settlement I have written to Terentia expressing my
intentions, since you were in Greece. Then please
look after my triumph. For as you were absent from
town, Ι sear the Senate hardly paid sufficient atten-
tion to my despatch. Ι

¹ The following point I will write to you in dark
1 phrases: your clevemess will scent my meaning. My
l wife's freedman (you know whom Ι mean) seemed
η to me lately from casual words of his to have cooked
his accounts on the sale of the goods of the Crotonian
’ tyrannicide.l I sear you have noticed something.
Look into this matter yourself alone, and secure
what is lest. I cannot write all my fears. Take care
that your letter flies to meet me. I write in haste
on the march and with my army. Give my love to
your wife and to your very charming little daughter.

of the well-known athlete of Croton of that name. The
freedman referred to is Philotimus. From v, 8it appears
that he bought for Cicero at the sale of Milo’s property.
