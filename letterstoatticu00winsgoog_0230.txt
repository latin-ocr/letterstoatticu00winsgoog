crosno ro urricus, 1111111110.
Your letter has posted me up inpolitical news to T teoa- ’
> May 25: 'and I am awaiting the course of events at dmm, 111116
Thessalonica, as you suggest. When Ι hear 11101017· ¹³·C· 53
l shall know where to be. For if there is any excuse,
11 anything is being done, 11 l see a ray of hope, l
shall either wait here 01 pay you a visit: but 11, 01 you
say in your letter, those hopes have vanished into air
l shall look for something else. At present you have
not given me the least hint of anything except the
disagreement of those friends 01 yours: and they are
quarrelling about anything rather than me, so l do
not see what good it will do me. But, as long as you
’ wish meto hope,I will bow to your wishes. You
frequently reproach me strongly 101 weak-hearted-
ness: but l should like 10 know if Ι have been spared
1 any hardship in my misfortune. Did anyone ever
fall from such ahigh estate in such a good cause,
especially when he was so well endowed with genius
and good sense, so popular and so strongly supported
by all honest men? Can Ι forget what l was? Can Ι
help feeling what l 01111 Can Ι help missing my
¹ honour and fame, my children, my fortune and my
brother? Thatis a fresh misfortune for you 100011-
