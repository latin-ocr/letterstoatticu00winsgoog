LETTERS TO ATTICUS 111. 19

, 1001111οε 01 the place make any difference to me now

that I shun the light 01 day entirely, but 1 should
like 10 sail back to freedom from a port 01 yourS,
and, 11 that hope is cut off, 1 could not find a better
place either 10 drag on my miserable existence, or,
what is preferable, to end it. l shall have few people
about me, and shall get 1100 110111 society. ’
- Your letters never aroused my hopes as much as
other people's : and yet my hopes were always 10111101
than your letters. However,r since some kind of a
movebas been made in the matter, whatever kind it
may be and whatsoever its cause,'l will not disappoint
either mydear and only brother’s sad and touching
entreaties, nor the promises of Sestius and othere, nor
the appeals 01 my wife in her deep affliction and my
little Tullia in her misery, nor your own true-hearted
letters. Epirus shall be my road back to freedom or
to what Ι 1110111100οᾶ before.

'² 1 beg and beseech‘you‚ Pomponius, as you see how
1 have been robbed 01 my honours and 01 my dearest
and fondest possessions by men's* treachery, as you see
how 1 was betrayed and cast aside by those on whose
advice 1 relied, as you know how 1 was forced into
betraying myself and my family, 01 your pity help me,
and support my brother Quintus, who is not past
salvation: guard Terentia and my children3 as 101
1110, wait for me in Rome, if you think there is any
chance 01 seeing me there. If 1101, 001110 10 see me,

11 you can, and allot me 01 your land enough 101 my
body to rest in ; and send a man with letters as soon
and as often as possible.
