LETTERS TO ATPICUS 1. 9·10

cronno το murcos, aaunrmo.

Your letters are much too few and far between, Rotae,
considering that it is much easier for you to find nc. 67
some one coming to Rome than for me to find any-
one going to Athena. Besides you can be surer
that Ι amat Rome than Ι ean be that you are in
Athens. The shortness of this letter is due to. my
doubts as to your whereabouts. Not knowing for
certain where you are, l don't want private corre-
spondence to fall into a stranger’s hands.

I am awaiting impatiently the statues of Megarie
marble and those of Hermea which you mentioned
in your letter. Don't hesitate to send anything else ,
of the same kind that you have, if it is fit for my
Academy. My purse is long enough. vThis is my little
weakness3 and what Ι want especially are those that
are fit for a Gymnasium. Lentulus promises his ships.
Please bestir yourself about it. Thyillus asks you, or
rather has got me to ask you, for some books on the
ritual of the Eumolpidae.

emano uo murcos, anamma.
When 1 was in my house at Tusculum—that’s tit Tarsensium,
¹ for tat against your “When I was in Ceramicus'’-but before ,luith
when Ι really was there, your sister sent a man from ac, 67
Rome with a letter from you, and told me that
some one was going to star-t for Greece that very
astemoon. So for laek of time Ι must make a very
short answer toyour letter. . .
