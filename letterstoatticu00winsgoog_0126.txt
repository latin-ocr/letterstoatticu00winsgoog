LETTERS TO ATTICUS ΙΙ. l

p But aa lt is, when the knights, whom Ι once stationed

ontheCapitoline hill with youastheir standard-beares
and leader, have deserted the Senate, and our great
men think themselves in the seventh heaven, if they
have bearded mullet in their lish-ponds that will feed
from their hand, and don‘t care about anything else,
surely you must allow that I have done my best,
if I manage to take the will to do harm from those
who have the power to do it. For our friend Cato is
not more to you than to me: but still with the best of
intentioris and unimpeachable honesty at times he
does harm to the country: for the opinions he de·
livers would be more in place in Plato’s Republic
. than among the dregs of humanity collected by
Romulusl That a man who accepts a bribe for the
verdict he returns at a trial should be put on trial
himself is as fair a principle as one could wish. Cato
voted for it and won the House’s assent. Result, a
war of the knights with the Senate, but not with me.
l was against it. That the tax-collectors should re·
pudiate their bargain wasamostshamelessproceeding.
But we ought to have put up with the loss in order to

ζ keep their good-will. Cato resisted and carried the
³ day. Result, though we’vehadaconsulinprison,and
frequent riots, not a breath of encouragement from

⁴ one of those, who in my own consulship and that of my

1 successore usedtorally round ustodefendthecouutry.

“Must we then bribe them for their support?” you
will ask. What help is there, if we cannot get it other-
wise? Are we to be slaves of freedmen and slaves?
But, as you say, enough of the grand serious.

¹Possibly “among the dregs of [the city] of Romulus ”;
but Plutarch, who translates it ἐν Ῥωμύλου ὑποστάθμῃ (Phoc.
3), is against that rendering.
