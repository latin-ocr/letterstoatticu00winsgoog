LETTERS TO ATTICUS ΙΙΙ. 22

XXII

crcnno 10 micus, anuarino.

Though my brother Quintus and Piso have sent Panly 01

1110 00101111 accounts 01 what has been' done, Ι 0111 Thessalo-
sorry you were too busy to write your usual full uico, partly«
description of events and of your surmises Plancius' 011111110-
kindness keeps me here still, though 1 have several cltum, Nou.
times tried to go to Epirus( He is inspired with a 16, ac. 68
hope, which l do not 0111110, that we may return to·
gether z which he hopes would redound to his honour.
But now, as soon as news arrives 01 the approach 01
the soldiers,l shall have to make an 011011 10 leave
him. When l do, I will send word to you at once and
let you know where I am. The courtesy which Len·
tulus shows in his actions, his promises and his lettere,
gives me some hope of Pompey's good will: 101 you
have osten mentioned that he would do anything 101
him. With Metellus, my brother tells me, you have
had as much success as he hoped. My dear Pompo-
111110, fight hard forme to be allowed to live with you
and with my family3 and send me all the news. I am
bowed down with grief through my longing 101 011
my dear ones, who have always been dearer 10 1110
111011 myself. Take care 01 yourself.

Knowing that I should be a very long time with·
out any news, 11 I went to Epirus through Thessaly,
and 11101 the people 01 Dyrrachium were warm
friends 01 1111110, 1 have come to them, aster writing
the first part 01 this letter at Thessalonica. As soon
as I leave here and go to your house, Ι will let you
know; and pleaselwrite me every detail 01 whatso-
ever kind. Now l look either 101 the fulfilment of
my hopes or 101 blank despair.
