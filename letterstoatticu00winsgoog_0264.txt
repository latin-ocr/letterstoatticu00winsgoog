LE'ITERS TO ATIICUS ΙΙΙ. 23

XXIII
cronno το Iuncus, susurrus.
' On the aoth of November l received three letters Dyrrachium,
r from you. In one of them, posted on the esth of Nou. 29,s.c.
l October, you exhort me to keep up my courage and 58
wait for January‚ and you give a full list of all the
hopeful signa, Lentulus’ zeal for my cause, Metellus’
l good will and Pompey'spolicy. One of the others is
¹ undated‚ which is unlike you; but you give a clear
¹ clue to the time, for you say you were writing it on
3. the very day that the bill was published by the eight
¹ tribuneS, th'at is to say the a9th of October: and you
state the advantages you think have resulted from
the publication of the law. If my restoration and
this law together are long past praying folgl hope
your affection will make you regard the trouble l am
taking about it with pity rather than amusement.
But, if there is still some hope, please see to it that
η our new magistrates set up a more careful case.
*⁶ For the old tribunes' bill had three sections, and the]
one about my return was carelessly worded3 it does
not provide for the restitution of anythIng but my.
citizenship and my position. In my fallen fortunes
that is enough forme, but you cannot fall to see what
¹ ought to have been stipulated and how The second
· clause is the usual form of indemnity: “ If in virtue'
of this law there be any breach of other laws‚” etc. '
But it is the third clause, Pomponius, to which
I would call your attention. What is its object, and
¹who put it in? You know that Clodius had so pro-
vided that¹ it was almost, if not quite impossible for

either the Senate or the people to annul liis law3
