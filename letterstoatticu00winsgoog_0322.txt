'cronno ro murcos, onearnvo
Our friend Vestorius has informed me by letter Cumae afier
that you are believed to have left Rome on the roth May 10,
of May, later than you said you would, because you nc. 54
, had not been quite well. Ι sincerely hope you are
better now. Would you please write home telling
>themto give me the run of your books, more espe-
ὲ cially of Varro,just as though you were there? Ι shall
ι have to use some passages from those books for the
ι works Ι have in hand, which Ι hope will meet with
your hearty approval. Ι should be glad if you would
let me know, if you happen to have any news, from
my brother Quintus particularly, or from C. Caesar,
or anything about the electioris and politica—you
generally have a pretty scent for such things. If you
have no news, write something anyhow: for no letter
of yours ever seemed ill-timed or long-winded to me.
But above all pray come back as soon as possible,
when your business and your tour are completed to
your satisfaction. Give my regards to Dionysius.
Take care of yourself.

ponius bya combination of yours and mine. It rs
really a great pleasure to me that Eutychides should
know that his heedom rs a favour granted on my
