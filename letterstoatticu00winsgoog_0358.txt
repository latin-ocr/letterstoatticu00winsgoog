and, whenyou have left, to let me know, believing

that there is nothing Ι hold dearer than yourself,

nothing that gives me more delight. I bade that

ὲ l On the loth of May, the date of this letter, I set Pompeii,
ξ out for my villa at Pompeii, to spend the day with May 10,

³ Pontiusmlus vrlla at Trebula Thereafterlmean to „Nc 51

do my day’ s Journey regularly without delay. While
1 was in my villa at Cumae, our friend Hortensius
paid me a very welcome visit. He asked if Ι had
any commissions and l gave hini commissions in

r general, and in particular to prevent to the best of

his ability extension of my term of office in my pro-
vince. Please keep him up to it, and tell him that
I was much gratified at his visit, and athis promises
' on that particular point and of any other assist-
ance Ι might need. Ι have bound our friend Fur-
niuS, who, Ι see, will be tribune next year, to help
me in the same matter. ’‘'My villa at Cumae was a
miniature Rome3 there were such a lot of people in
the neighbourhood. In the middle of it all our friend
Rufio, seeing that Vestorius was on his trackS, bailled

¹ the man by aruse; for he did not corne to me. You

may be surprised that he did not come, seeing that

Hortensius came, who is ill, lives afar off and isa

J great man, and crowds of other people came as well.

I repeat he did not come. You may infer I did not

see him. How could I fail to see him when Ι travel-
