creaao ro armena, anuarino.
Ι see you know of my arrival at my Tusculan villa vaulum, ¹
on the rath of November. There Ι was met by aflei* Νῦν· ,
÷ Dionysius. Iwant to be back in Rome on the l7th. ll, nc. 55
³ When I say want, I mean Ι have to be in town for ’
Milo’s wedding. There is some idea of an election.
Even isit has come off, Iam not at all sorry to have
missed' the disputes which I hear have taken place in
. the Senate. For Ι should elther have had to give
my support against my conscience, or neglect my
bounden duty. But Ι hope to goodness you will
write me as full a description as possible of that
affair and of the present state of politice and tell me -
how the consuls are taking all this pother. I am
ravenous for news, and, to tell you the truth, Ι sus-
y pect everything. They say our friend Crassus made
a less digniliedstart1 in his uniform than L. Paulus
of old, who rivalled him in age andin his two consul-
ships. What apoor thing he is! Ihave been work·
ing hard at the books on oratory: and have had them
on hand a long time and done a lot to them: you
can have them copied. Again 1 beg you to send me
a sketch of the present situation, that I may not feel
an utter stranger when I get back.

¹ For Syria.
