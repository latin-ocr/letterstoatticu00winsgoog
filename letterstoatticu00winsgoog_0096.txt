LETTERS TO ATTICUS 1. 18

Clodian drama became the topic of discussion. There

Ι thought Ι had a chance of using the surgeon’s

l knife on licentiousness and curbing youthful excess-
³ es: and I exerted myself‚ putting forth all the re-
g sources of my intellect and mind, not out of private
j spite, but in the hope of effecting a radical cure of
the State. The corruption of the jury by bribery and
debauchery dealt a crushing blow to the republic.
See what has followed. We have had a consul forced
on us, at whom no oue except us philosophers can
look without a sigh. That is a fatal stroke. Though
a senatorial decree has been passed about the bribery
of juries, no law has been 'carried; the Senate has
been frightened out of it, and the knights have been
estranged. So this one year has overturned two
bulwarks of the State which had been erected by me
alone: for it has destroyed the prestige of the Senate
and broken up the harmony of the orders. Now
comes this precious year. It was inaugurated by
the suspension of the annual rites of the goddess of
youth: for Memmius initiated M. Lucullus’ wife into
some rites of his own. Menelaus took it hard and
divorced his wife. Unlike the shepherd of Ida, who
only slighted MenelauS, our modern Paris thought
Agamemnon¹ as fitting an. object for his contempt.
There is one C. Herennius, a tribune—you may not
even know him, though perhaps you do, as he is a
member of the same tribe as yourself, and his father
Sextus used to distribute money to your tribesmen-
heis trying to transfer P. Clodius to the plebs, and
even proposes that the whole people shall vote on

the matter in the Campus Martius. l gave him my
¹ L. Lucullus, whose claim to a triumph Memmius opposed

as tribune in 66·65 ac.
