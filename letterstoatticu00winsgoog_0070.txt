sadly upset and bemOaning their contact with infamy.
,llAt the preliminary proceedings, as point after point
, was put before the jury, thbir strictand unanimous ¹
¹, uprightness was extraordinary. «The defendant never
won a point, ¹and the prosecution were granted more
than they asked for. It goes‘ without saying that
Hortensius was triumphant at his penetration3 and no
¹one regaffiffl'l'llodins so much as‘aman on hist ial as
one that had been condemned a thousand tim s over.
, You have no doubt heard how the jury rose in a body
to protect me, when 1 ste'pped into the witness-box
and Clodius' supporters began to hoot: and how they
offered their throats to Clodins' sword in defence of a
me. Thereby', to my mind they paid me a far higher
. compliment than your fellow-citizens paid Xeno-
crates, when they refused to let him take the oath
before giving his testimony, or our Roman jury paid
Metellus Numidicus, when they would not look at
the accounts which he passed round as is usual in
such cases.¹ Ι repeat, the honour shown me was far
greate'rss The shouts ofthe jury,'droclaiming me as
the saviour of the country erushed'ffissamithilated
the defendant and all his snpporters And on the
next day a crowd as great as'that‘which conducted
me home at the end of my consulship gathered
round me. Our noble Areopagites declared they
would not come without a guard. The votes of the
.· court were taken, and there was only one person who
voted a guard unnecessary. The point was laid before
the Semne, who passed a decree in the strongest and
most complimentary termS, thanking the jury and
referring the matter to thd magistrates. No one 2
’ ,thought Clodius would defend his case. “Tell me iliadxvi,112 i
. now, ye Muses, how first the fire fell.’‘
