LETTERS TO Amoris ΙΙΙ. 14-15

The amount of traffic on the roads and the daily
expectation of a change of govemment have pre-
vented me from leaving Thessalonica at present. But
now Ι am forced to quit, not by Plancius—who
wants me to stop-but by the nature of the place,
which is not at all suitable to help one to bear such
distress and nrisfortune. Ι did not go to Epirus as Ι
said Ι should, since all the news and all the letters '
that have reached me lately have shown me that
there was uo necessity to romain very near ltaly. lf
I get any important news from the scene of the ,
elections‚ Ι shall betake myself to Asia, when Ι leave
here. Where exactly, is not yet fixed: but Ι will let
you know.

Thessalonica, July 21.

cronno To mneos, suranna
On August 13 Ι received four letters from you,— Thessalo-
· one in terms of reproof, urging me to firmness, an· nica, Aug
other telling me of Crassus' freedman's account 0s17, nc. 58
my carewom appearance, a third relating the doings
in theHouse‚ anda fourth containing Varro’sconfirma-
tion of your opinionasto Pompey’swishes. Myanswer ,
to the first is that though I am distressed, it has not
unhinged my mind: noy, l am even distressed that,
though my mind is so sound, Ι have neither place nor
opportunity for using it. For, if you feel the loss of
a single friend like myself, what do you suppose my
feelings are, when I have lost you and every one else?
And is you, on whom no ban of outlawry has fallen,
miss my presence, you can imagIne the aching void
outlawry leaves in me. Ι will not mention all that Ι
