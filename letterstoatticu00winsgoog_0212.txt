LETTERS TO ATTICUS 11. 25

—not that he was, but to make him do it For, as
you know, he is an odd creature, “all tortuous
thoughts and no -''.¹ But Ι hold ιο the maxim,
“A great man's follies.”² However, your other friend,
Hortalus, most certainly lauded me to the skies in
the most liberal, open-hearted and elaborate manner, ,
when he was delivering a speech on Flaccus' praetor·
ship and that incident of the Allobroges. You may

’ ’ take my word for it that he could not have expressed

himself in more affectionate and laudatory terms, nor
more fully. Ι should much like you to write and tell
him that Ι sent you word of it. But 1 hope you won’t
have to write, and are now on your way and quite
close aster the appeals in my former letter. Iam
eagerly lacking out for you, and in sore need of you:
and circumstances and the times call for you as much
as Ι do.

On these affairs Ι have nothing new to say: the
country is in the most desperate position possible,
and nothing could exceed the unpopularity of those
who are responsible for it. I myself, as 1 think,
hope and imagine, am safeguarded by the staunchest
support. So hasten your coming: you will either
relieve all my cares or share them with me. If Ι am

rather brief, it is because Ι hope that 1 may soon be ²

vable to discuss anything Ι wish with you face to face.
Τ ake care of yourself.

but all roundabout.''
