LETTERS ΤΟ A'lTICUS Vl. l

Ι, intend to celebrate Quintus’ coming of age ¹ on the
feast of Bacchus.² His father asked me to do this, ,
and Ι shall act on the assumption that there will be no
addition to the calendar. Dionysius is in my good
graces: but the boys say he is liable to mad lits of
temper. However one could not get a master oi
more learning and better character and more liking
for you and me. The praise you hear of Thermus
and Silius is deserved: they conduct themselves in
’ very honourable fashion. You may praise Μ. Nonius,
Bibulus, and myself too, if you like. Ι only wish
Scrofa had scope for his tact. He is a fine fellow.
The rest do little credit to Cato's caucus. 1 am much
obliged to you for recommending my case to Horten-
sius. As to Amianus Dionysius says there is no help.
Ι have met with no trace of Terentius. Moeragenes
has certainly been killed. Imade a tour through his
district and found not a living thing. I did not know
this, when Ι spoke to your agent Democritus. Ι have
ordered the Rhosian ware for you. But what the
J deuce will you serve up in poreelain‚ when you are
accustomed to give us vegetarian fare on fem-pattern
plates and in magnificent baskets? I have ordered a
’ horn for Phemius, and one will be got. 1 only hope
that his tune will bc worthy of the instrument.

A war with the Parthians is imminent. Cassius'
despatch was futile, Bibulus‘ has not yet come. Ι ⁴
think the reading of it'wfll atir the House to action
at last. lamvery anxious myself. lf, as Ι hope, my
¹ tenure of office is not extended‚ I have June and J uly

¹On coming of age, which took place at about 15 or 16,
the Roman boy left off the purple-bordered toga praetexta
and assumed the pure wahllzftgff‘l 7uirilis.
