LETTERS TO ATTICUS V. 8-9 ’

the following. Ι have received a letter from Rome,
saying that my friend Milo writes complaining of ill-
treatment from me, for allowing Philotimus to have
ἵ ‚a hand in the purchase of his property. lactedon ·
the advice of C. Duronius, a man whom Ι saw to be
most friendly to Milo, and just such a person as you
suppose him to be. His plan and mine was this,
f firstly,'to keep a hold over Milo's property «for fear
r some hard bargainer, a stranger to us, should rob him
, of his slaves, of whom a great number were with
³ him3 and secondly, that the settlement he intended
to make on Fausta should be respected. There was
the further intention, that we ourselves should have
the readiest means of saving anything that could be
saved. ‘Now please review the whole matter, for
letters to me often exaggerate. If Milo complains
and writes to his friends, and, if Fausta wishes, as Ι
told Philotimus and as he agreed, Ι would not have
him purchase the ⁴ property against Milo‘s wish.
Nothing would compensate for offending Milo. You ,
will 'judge if the matter has been exaggerated.
Please consult Duronius Ι have written also to
Camillus and to Lamia, among other reasons because
Ι do not feel sure you are in town. To surn up, in

deciding be careful of my honour, reputatiou aud
interests. ⁷
