i With regard to my candidature, in which Ι know Eme, Jaly,
Ι you take the greatest interest, things stand as fol-1³·c·65

· lows, so far as one can guess at present. P. Galba,
› is the only canvasser who is hard at work3 and h''e

meets with a plain and simple, old-fashioned, No.
i As people think, this unseemly haste of his in oan-
' vassing is by no means a bad thing for my interests:
for most refusals imply a pledge of support to me.
So I'have hope that I may derive some advan-
, tage from it, when the news gets abroad that my
supporters are in the majority, Ι had thought of
beginning to convass in the Campus Martius at the
, election of tribunes on the 17th of July, the very
ι’ time that, Cincius tells me, your man will be starting
Ῐ with this letter. lt seems certain that Galba, An-
tonius, and Q. Cornificius will be standing with me.
Ι oan imagine your smile or sigh at the news. To
make you tear your hair, there are some who think
Ι Caesonius will be a candidate too. Ι don’t suppose
y Aquilius will. He has said not, pleading his illness
i and his supremaoy ,in the law oourts in excuse.
i Catiline will be sure to be standing, if the verdiot is,
’ ’ Νο suu at midday. of course you will know all about
Aufidius and Palicanus, without waiting for letters
ι from me. of those who are standing, Caesar is
ἱ ¹thought to be a certainty: the real fight is expected
