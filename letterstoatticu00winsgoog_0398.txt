Lamnus ro 'armeus v. 17-18

as I am in my summer camp, Ι fancied that would be
¹ the best place for them. “
' Sestius wrote me an account of his conversation

Ι with you about my pressing domestic affairs, and of

your opinion. Please devote yourself to the business
and write to me what can be done and what you think.
Sestius told me that Hortensius has said something
or other about extending my term of office. He
undertook at Cumae to take good care that it should
not outlast a year. If you have any regard 'for me,
get that point fixed up squarely. l cannot describe
my dislike to being away from you. MoreoverI hope
that my justice and restraint may become more fa-
mous, if I leave soon: for it was so In the case of
Scaevola, who govemed Asia only nine months.

On seeing that I was about to arrive, our friend
Appius left Laodicea and went up to Tarsus. I am
not offended at the slight he has done me by holding
court while Ι am in the province, for I have enough
business to heal the wounds that he has inflicted on
it: and I try to do this with as little reflection on him
as possible. But please tell our friend Brutus, that
his father-in-law has not acted well in going away as
far as he could on my arrival. ·
