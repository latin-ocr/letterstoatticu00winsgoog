LETTERS TO ATTICUS IV. 1

am in great difficulties with it and stand in need not
so much of your meam, which Ι know Ι can look Α

¹ upon as my own, as of your advice to guther the frag-
* ments together and arrange matters

Now, though 1 suppose you have had all the news . -
from your family or from messengers 3ηά rumour, Ι

' will give you a short account of everything Ι think you

would rather leam from my letters, On the ath of

Ι August, the very day the law aboutme was proposed,I

started from Dyrrachium, 3ηά arrived at Brundisium on
the 5th. Theremy little Tullia was waiting forme, ori·
her own birthday, which, as it happened, was the com-

memoration day of Brundisium 3ηά of the temple of '

Safetynearyourhouse too. The coincidencewasnoticed
aud the people of Brundisium held great celebratiohs.

ὲ On the 8th of August, while Ι was stillat Brundisium,

Ι heard from Quintus that the law had been passed
in the Comitia Centuriata with extraordinary enthu-
³ siasm of all ages and ranks in Italy who haditocked
’ to Rome in thousands. lThen Ι started on my
’ journey amid the rejoicings of all the loyal folk of
Brundisium, and was met everywhere by deputa·
tions offering congratulations. When Ι came near
the city, there was not a soul of any class known
to my attendant,l who did not come to meet me,
except those enemies who could neither hide nor
deny their enmity. When Ι reached the Capenau
Gate, the steps of the tem¹ples were thronged with
N the populace. Their joy was exhibited in loud
l applause ε· 3 similar crowd acc'ompanied me withlike

, applause to the Capitol, and in the Forum and on the
ἵ very Capitol there was an extraordinary gathering.

1Α nomenclator attended canvassers and others to tell
them the names of persons they met.
