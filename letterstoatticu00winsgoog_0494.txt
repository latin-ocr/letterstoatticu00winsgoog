LETTERS TO ATTICUS VI. 7-8

Tiro would have written you a letter, but l lest him
at Issus seriously ill. Howevcr a message has
reached me that he is better. Still Ι arn upset: for
he is a model youth and very attentive.

crcnno ro murcos, annornm.
Just as I had determined to write to you and had Ephesus,
taken up my pen, Batonius came straight from his Oct. 1, nc.
ship to my house at Ephesus and gave me youroo
letter on the syth of September. I am delighted
about your good voyage, and your opportune meet-
ing with your wife and also at her remarks about the
marriage of my daughter. But Batonius brought
news that was simply awful about Caesar, and was
-even more frank in conversation with Lepta. I hope
¹ his news is false: it was certainly terrifying. He
says that Caesar will refuse to disband his army, that
the officials elect, praetorS, Cassius the tribune and
i Lentulus the consul take his part, and that Pompey
ι thinks of leaving Rome.
But by the by, are you so sorry for the fellow that
thinks himself superior to the uncle of your sister’s
son? What line opponents to beat him! But to
business.
The Etesian winds have hinde1·ed me much: the
open Rhodion buath too caused me a delay of exactly
twenty days. On the lst of October, as Ι am embark-
ing from Ephesus, Ι give this letter to L. Tarquitius,
whois leaving the harbour at the same time, butsailing
by a faster boat. I have had to wait for fair westher
owing to the undecked boats and other war vessels
of the Rhodians. Howevcr l am hurrying as fast as·
possible. ·
