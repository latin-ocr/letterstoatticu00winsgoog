LETTERS TO hiulcus Ι. 14

snap up the chance of winning popularity, which he
had thrown away, and perhaps at realizing‘the im-
portance of my achievements, when he saw that
praise of them met with the Sepate's entire approval,

especially coming from one who had all the less neces-
sity to praise mc, because in every one of my works
he has been censured for Pompey's benefit, Qso-day
has done a great deal to cement my friendship with
Crassus: but still I gladly received any crumbs
Pompey let fall openly or covertly.1 As forme, ye
gods, how I showed off before my new listenee*
Pompey! Then, if ever, my flow of rounded periodsp
my easy transitions, my antitheses, my constructive
arguments stood me in good stead. ln a word, loud‘
applausc! For the ›gist of it was the importance of
the Senatorial order, its unison with the knights, the
concord of 'all Italy, the paralysed remains of the ’

conspiracy, peace and plenty. You know how 1 can .

thunder on a subject like that. This time my thun-
ders were so loud that l forbear to say any more

passing the Senate’s measure, all those callow youthS,
Catiline's cubs, met under the leadership of Curio’s'
feminine son, and asked the people to reject it. The
consul Piso had to proposc the law, but spoke against
it. Clodius' rowdies held the gangways3 and the
voting papers were so managed that no placet forms
were given out. Then you have Cato flying to the

¹0r “let fall with obvious covertness”; or “I openly re·
ceived what he covertly gave. ’³
