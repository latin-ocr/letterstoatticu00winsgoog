LETTERS TO A'I'I'ICUS 1v. 3

the Senate, and had nearly got as high as the ro'ol,
was knocked down:⁴ my brother Quintus’ house was
first smashed by a discharge of stones from my plot,
and then set on fire under Clodius’ orders by fire-

brands hurled before the eyes of the whole city, . ,
’ amidst the groans and growls-l will not say of the

loyal party, which seems to have vanished out ol
existence—but simply of every human creature. He
was rushing about in a frenzy, thinking of nothing
but the slaughter of his enemies aster this mad freak,
and canvassing the city quarter by quarter, openly
promising liberation to slaves. Before this, when he
was trying to shirk his trial, he had a case hard in-
deed to support and obviously wrongful, but still it

was a case: he could deny things, he could put the
. blame on others, he could even plead that he had the

right on his side in some respecta But after this
, wreckage, arsonand pillage, his own supportem have
l left him in the lurch and he hardly has a hold now
even on Decimus the marshal, or Gellius: he has to
take slaves into his confidence and sees, that if hc

¹ openly commits all the murders he wishes to commit,
ὲ his case before the court will not be one whit worse

than it is now. So, on the llth of November, as l

. was going down the Sacred Way, he followed me with

his gang. There were shouts, stones, clubs, swords,
all without a moment’s warning. We stepped aside

’ . into Tettius Damio's hall: and those who were with
‡ me easily prevented his roughs from entering. He

might have been killed himself: but l have got tired
of surgery and am beginning a regime cure. He
realized that there was a universal outcry not for his

¹ prosecution hut for his execution, and has since

behaved in such a way that a Catiline looks ultra·
