LETTERS TO A'lTlCUS V. 6-8

you all my commissions, and please execute them aa
you promise. Ι will send you any fresh news, when
Ι have it. One matter I shall not cease to request
so long as Ι think you are in towns-that you will
leave mydebt to Caesar settled. Ι await eagerly a
letter from you, especially that Ι may know the date
of your leaving Rome. ’

monuo ro amcos, susurrus.

Daily, or rather more and more every day, Ι send Tarentum,
you shorter letters: for daily Ι suspect more than May 20,
ever that you have started for Epirus. However, to ac. 51
inform you that Ι have taken in hand your previous
commission z-Pompey says that he will appoint five

new prefects, exempting them from serving on juries.

’ For myself, after spending three days with Pompey at
his house, Ι arn setting out for Brundisium on the auth
of May. Ι am leaving behind me a noble citizen, well-

prepared to ward off the dangers we fear. lshall
await your letters to inform me of your actions and
whereabouta ’

, crosno ro urrrcus, susurrus.

Tiresome indisposition, from which Ι have re· Brundisium,
covered, as there was no fever with my ailment, and June 2 or 3,
also my awaiting Pomptinus, of whom so far no news uc. 51
has reached me, have detained me now twelve days
at Brundisium: but I am looking for an opportunity
to sail. Ι scarcely imagine that you are in town3

but, if you are, please give your closest attention to
