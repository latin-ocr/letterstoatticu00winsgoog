LETTERS TO ATTmUS V. 10

c1cnno ro anneus, anuarino.
Ι came to Athens on the a5th of June, and 1 have Athens, June
Ἴ waited three days for PomptinuS, but. have heard 29 or July 1,
nothing certain of his coming. Believe me, you are nc. 51
ι with me all the time, and, though it did not need
ὲ associations to tum my thoughts towards you, still Ι
l was reminded of you more than ever by treading in
3 your footsteps. lndeed we talk of nothing else, but
l you ; hut perhaps you prefer to have news about my-
j self. So far no public body or private person has spent
³ money on me oron my stall. Ihave not eventaken
’ the barest necessities allowed by the law of Julius,
nor have l billeted myself on anyone. My staff have
made up their minda that they must uphold my good
name. So far everything has gone well: the Greeks
have noted it and are full of outspoken praise. For
the rest I ain endeavouring to act as I know you would
like„ But let us reserve our praise for the end of the
story. In other respects Ι osten blame my mistake
in not having found some methodos escape from this
flood of affairs. The business is little suited to my
tastes lt is a true saying‚ “Cobbler‚ stick to your
last.’‘l You will say: “What, already? You have
not yet begun your work.'' Τοο true, and 1 fear
’ worse is to come. lput up with things with cheer-
fulbrow and smiling faee; but Ι suffer in my'heart
of hearts There is so much ill temper and insolence‚
such stupid folly of'every kind, such arrogant talk and
such sullen silence to be put up with every day. Ι

paSs over this, not because Ι wish to conceal it, but
