2 much it is, and l should liketoknow. However, we

can discuss this later and more conveniently when
w .
eTllldtetremark at the end oi your letter, my dear

y Atticus, upset me. You used the phrase, “Whatmore

l

'is there to say,” and follow it hya most affectionate
waming not to forget to be on the watch and to keep
an eye on events. Have you heard anything about
any of my staff? Ι am sure there has been no wrong-
doing, pas du tout. lt could not have escaped my

y notice, and it will not. Bnt your earnest entreaty

seemed to hint something.

As for M. Octavius, l repeat that your reply was
excellent. 1 could wish it had been in more positive
terms} For Caelius has sent me a freedman of his
and a carefully worded letter about panthere and an
offer from the townships to furnish contributions. l
replied that the second item is annoying, if my con-
ductis stilla secret and the news has not reached
town that in my province no money is exacted except
in satisfaction of debts: and I have told him that it
would be improper for me to allow payment and for
him to take it. Ι have a sincere regard for him and
have warned him that alter his prosecution of other
peopleheshould conduct himself on more careful lines
As to the second point l have told him it would be
a blot on my escutcheon that the people of Cibyra
should have a public hunt during my governorship.

Lepta leaps with joy over your letter3 for ·it was

ἶ nicely written and puts me in his good graces. Your
’ tiny daughter has done mea favour in ordering you

earnestly to send meher greetings( lt was kind of

Pilia and very dutiful of your daughter to send greet-

ings toene whom aa yet she has never met. So please
