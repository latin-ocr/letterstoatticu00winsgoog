LETTERS TO ATI’ICUS 1. 18

usual reception in the Senate3 but he is the most}
phlegmatic of mortals. Metellus is an excellenti
consul andan admirer of mine3 buthe has lessenedf
his inlluence by making, only for form’s sake, the?
verysame proposal about Clodius. But Aulus' son-4
heavens above! what a cowardly and spiritless

wretch fora soldier! Just fit to be exposed, as he
¹ ἰε, to the daily abuse of Palicanus. An agrarian law
has been proposed by Flavius,-a very paltry pro-
duction, almost identical with the Plotian law And '
in the* meantime not the ghost of a real statesman
is to be found. The man who could be one, my inti-
mate friend-for so he ia, I would have you to know
—Pompey, wraps that precious triumphal cloak of his
around him in silence. Crassus never utters a word
to risk his popularity. The others you know well
enough—fools who seem to'hope that their fish-ponds
may be saved, though the countrygo to rack and
ruin. There is one who can be said to take some
puina, but, according to my view, with more constancy
and honesty than judgement and ability—Cato. It
is now three months that he has been worrying
those wretched tax-collectore, who used to be
great -friends of his, and won’t let the Senate give
them an answer. So we are forced to suspend
all decrees on other subjects until the tax-collectore
have had an answer. And I suppose even the
embassies¹ will have to be postponed for the same
reason.

. Now you see the sturm we have to weather; and,
as you can grasp from what I have written with such
emphasiS‚ something of what Ι have lest unwritten,

come and see me again3 for it is high time. Though
¹ F orelgn ambassies were received in February.
