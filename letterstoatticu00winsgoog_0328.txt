missas ro Arncus ιν. 15

Scaurus3 but whether ostensibly or in earnest is more
than one can say. None of themis romping abead:
money levels all their ranks. Messalla is not in the
running, not that his heart or his friends have failed
him, but the coalition of the consuls and Pompey are
both against him. Ι think the elections will have to
be postponed. The candidates for the tribunate have
taken an oath to submit their conduct to Cato's
approval, and have deposited 34,400¹ with him on
the condition that any one of them who is con-
demned by Cato shall lose it and it shall be given' to
his rivals.

1 am writing this the day before the elections are
expected to come off. But on the asch 1 will give you
a full account of them, if they have taken place and
the messenger has not started. If there really is no
bribery at them, which people think will be the case,
then Cato alone will have done more than all the

, laws and all the law courts can do. Ι am acting for
Messius, who has been recalled from his office.
Appius had given him a commission on caesar’s staff:
but Servilius issued a warrant requiring his presence.
The tribes he has to face are the Pomptine, Veline
and Maecian. It is a sharp struggle, however itis
getting on fairly well. Tben Ι have to get ready for

’ Drusus and aster that ior Scaurus. These will make
grand titles for my speeches. Ι may even have the
names of the consuls elect to add to the list3 and, if
Scaurus is not one of them, he will find himself in
serious difficulties in this trial.

From my brother Quintus' letters Ι suspect heis
now in Britain, and Ι am very anxious to know how

l heis getting on. One point Ι have certainly gained:
¹ 5oo,ooo sesterces.
