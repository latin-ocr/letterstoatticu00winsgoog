LETTERS TO ATTICUS Ι. at

mise and come if you possibly can manage it. You
will be in time for my brother Quintus' electiori:
you will see me aster all this long while3 and you
will settle the bother with Acutilius. The latter point
Peducaeus too suggested that I should mention to‘
you: we think it would be much better for you to

demy‚ since no class-mom is complete without a
Hermes, and Minerva has a special appropriateness
in mine. So please do as you suggest and send as

and shan't envy any man his manors and meadows.
