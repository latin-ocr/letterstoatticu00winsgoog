LETTERS TO ATTICUS VI. 5

CICERO To mietio, GREETING.

You must certainly be at Rome now. ΙΙ you are, Io camp, ,

Ι am glad of your saie arrival. So longas you were June 26, ¹
away from town, you seemed to me to be further off ac. 50
than if you were in Rome, for Ι heard less of my own
business and less of the business of the state. So
please send plenty of chatty letters on every kind of
subject to meet me, though I hope, when you read

Ἴ this, Ι shall be well on my journey home. Above all

’ write me on the subject I raised in my former letter.

¹ From the stuttering hesitation of my wife's freedman
in our meetings and talks I infer that he has been
cooking his accounts a little in the matter of the sale

l of the Crotonian’s1 goods. investigate the matter

l with your usual care, but pay still more attention to

ἑ this. When leaving the city of the seven hills he
tendered an account of debts of some 3100 and 32002
to Camillus, and put himself down as owing 3100
from Milo’s goods and 2200 from the property in the
Chersonese, and as having inherited two sums of
ΞΞΙΙΟΟ,8 of which not a penny had been paid, though
all were due on the lst of the second mouth. Milo’s

, freedman, TimotheuS, the namesake of Conon’s
father, he said, had never given a thought to the
matter. Now first try and secure the whole amount,

3 and secondly don’t overlook the interest from the
afore-mentioned day. All the time I had to endure
him, I was much upset. He came to me to spy out

¹ hes T. Annius Milo.
