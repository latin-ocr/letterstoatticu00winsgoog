LETTERS TO ATTICUS V. 18

being held of Roman citizens: corn is being brought
from the country into safe strongholds. Should
occasion arise, Ι should defend myself by force, but ·
otherwise Ι shall depend on my position. So be of

2 good cheer. You are always in my mind’s eye, ond

l understand your affectionate sympathy as if you
were standing here. But 1 beseech you, if it can be
arranged and supposing that my case is not debated
in the House up to the first of January, to be in Rome ’
during that month. Ι shall be treated fairly, if you

l are there. The consuls are my friends3 Furnius the·
tribune of the people is devoted to me: but l want
you with your ingratiating and skflful persistence.

¹ It is a critical time. But it would be a shamefor me
to press you further.

My son and nephew are staying with Deiotarus.

If necessary, they shall be sent to Rhodes. If you
are in Rome, send me a message with your usual

Ἴ regularity. And even if you are in EpiruS, send me ι

’ one of your messengerS, that you may know my pro-
ceedings, and I may know your present and future
plans , Ι am managing your friend Brutus' business
better than he could himself. But Ι now hand my
ward¹ over to the creditors and refuse to set up any
plea for him. They are an impracticable and im·

, pecunious lot. However Ι shall satisly you, which is
more difficult even than satislying Brutus Indeed Ι
will satisfy you both.

B 'itriobarzaneo King of Cappadocia, who owed money io
ru us.
