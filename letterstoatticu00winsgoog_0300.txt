· LETTERS TO ATTICUS lV. 4α·5

' send me two of your library slaves for Tyrannio -to
employ to glue pages together and assist in general,
and would tell them to get some bits of parchment
to make title-picces,' which Ι think you Greeks call

. “sillybi” But that is only if it is convenient to you.

,Ι In any case mind you come yourself,· if you can stick
in such a place, and bring Pilia with you. For that
is only right and Tullia wishes her to come. My
word! you have bought a fine troop. Ι hear your
gladiators are fighting splendidly. If you had cared

' to let them out, you would have cleared your expenses
on these two shows. But of that later. Be sure you
come, and, as you love me, remember the library
slaves.

cicaro ro auricus, anamma.
Come now, do you really imagine Ι prefer my things Antium,
to be read andcriticizedbyanyone but you? Thenwhy Apr. or
did Ι send them to anyone else first? The man l sent May, nc. 56
them to was very pressing and Ι had not a copy. Any-
thing else? Well , yos—though l keep mouthing the pill
instead of swallowing it-l was a bit ashamed of. my
' palinode. But good-bye to honesty, straightforward-
' ness and uprightness! You would hardly believe
. the treachery of our leaders, as they want to be and
would be, if they had any honour. 1 knew full well
how they had taken me in, abandoned me and cast
me offi Still Ι resolved to stick to them in politics.
But they have proved the same as ever: and at last
Ι have come to my senses under your guidance. You

will say your advice applied exclusively to my actions

and did not include writing too. The fagala, Ι
