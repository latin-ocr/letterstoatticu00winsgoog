LETTERS TO ATTICUS IV. 8a-9

Domitius has only one rival in his missortunes-the
country which has given up even hoping for better
days.

Your letter was the first to give me information
about Natta: Ι could never abide the man. You ask
about my poem. Well, what if it wants to take wing?
Will you let it? Ι had begun to mention Fabius

ᾗ Luscus: he was always a great admirer of mine, and
Ι never disliked him, for he was intelligent enough
and very worthy and unassuming. As Ι had not seen
him for a long time, I thought he was away: but Ι
hear from this follow Gavius of Firmum that the man
is in Rome and has been here all along. It struck
meas odd. You will say it is an insignificant trille.
But he had told me a good many things, of which there

η was no doubt, about those brothers from Firmum: and
what has made him shun me, if he has shunned me,
Ι cannot imagine. ι

Your advice to act diplomatically and not to steer
too close to the wind¹ Ι will follow: but Ι shall want
more than my own stock of wisdom3 so, as usual, Ι
shall draw on you. Please scent out anything you
can from Fabius, if you can get at him, and suck that
guest of yours dry, and write to me every day' about
these points and anything else. When you have
nothing to write, write and say so. Look aster your-

seli

Ι should much like to know whether the tribunes Napla, ⁸
are hindering the census by declaring days void—ior Apr, 27,
there is a rumour to that effect-and what is happen- Μ, 55
ing about the census in general and what people are

ιΙΙΙ. “Keep the outside course’‘ in a chariot race.
