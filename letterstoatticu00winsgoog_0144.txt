LETTERS TO ATTICUS ΙΙ. 6

rather than in Rome. You have been wiser in your
generation and made a home for yourself at Buth-
rotum: but you may take my word for it that this

i township of Antium runs your borough very close.

To think of there being a place so near Rome, where

ἶ there are lots of people who have never seen Vati-

l

nius where there is not a single soul save myself
who cares whether any ol our new commissioners are
alive or dead, where no one intrudes upon me, though
every one is fond ofme. This, this is the very place for
me to play the politician: forthere in Rome, besides
being shut out of politics, Ι am sick of them. So I
will compose a private memoir, which Ι will read only
tn you, in the style of Theopompus, or even a still
bitterer vein. My only policy now is hatred of the
radicals: and that without rencour, indeed with some
pleasure in expressing it.

But to return to business, Ι have written to the
city quaestors about my brother Quintus' affairs
See what they have to say, and whether there is any
hope of our getting current coin, or whether we
must put up with Pompey's pice.¹ Also decide what
is to be done with the wall. Is there anything else
I meant to say? Yes3 Let me know when you
think of going away.

¹Tlre cistophorus was an Asiatie coin, of which Pompey
had deposited a large quantity in the treasury. Apparently

there was some idea of using them sor paying Quintus
during his proconsulship.
