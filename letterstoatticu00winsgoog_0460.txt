LETTERS TO ATTICUS Vl. 1-2

mysteries at Rome, and how you are passing the
winter. Kcep well. Ι write this on the seven
Ιὲἓῖῗέξὲἱι and sixty-fifth- day aster the battle of

c1csao ro armeus, ousrrrrvo.
Your freedman Philogenes has corneto visit me Laodicea,
at Laodicea and tells me that he is on the point of Moy,

ᾗ sailing to join you: so Ι give him this letter in reply ac. 50

l to your letter which Ι got from Brutus¹ letter-camier.

First Ι will answer your last page which caused 'me
much concern :—that is about Cincius’ communica-
tion on the talk he had with Statius. lwas par-
ticularly concerned at Statius' remark that the plan
had my approval. Approval indeed! luced only
say thus much. Ι wish the ties of friendship to be
as many and close as possible between ις, though
none can be so close as those of our common liking.

. Ι am far from wanting the tie between usto be
relaxed. Quintus however to my knowledge will
osten use bitter language on his private affairs, and

ἲ osten Ι have pacified his anger, as Ι think you know.

J 011 my late tour or military campaign Ι have seen

l him osten fly in a temper and osten calm again. Ι
don’t know what he wrote to Statius3 whatever he
meant to do, he ought not to have informed a freed-
man. However Ἰ will do my best to prevent any
course contrary to our wishes and to propriety. ln
a case like this it is not enough for a man to make
himself responsible for his own conduct only: and
, ¹Cicero refers-thus to the killing of Clodius on Jan. 18,

{a 1503, compar-ing it with the defeat of the Spartans, by
pammondas at Leuctra 111371 lae.
