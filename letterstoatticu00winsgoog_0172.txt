LETTERS TO ATTICUS ΙΙ. 16

For up to now he has chopped logic about the mat-
ter, saying that he approved of Caesar's laws, but it
was for Caesar to see to their passing: that the agra-
rian law was sound enough to his mind, but whether
it could be vetoed by a tribune or not did not matter
to him: he thought it was high time the question·
was settled with the king of Alexandria: whether
Bibulus had been watching for omens or not at that
particular moment was no business of his: as for the
tax-gatherers, they were a class that he wished to

'check with Caesar’s army,'’ he says. No, not me at*

ι ungrateful minds ⁵of, the so-called constitutionalistS,
who have not repaid my services even by thanks,·
much less by more substantial rewards. But, ifl
were really to rouse myself to energy against that
party, Ι would certainly find some means of resisting

friend Theophrastus, Dicaearchus giving the prefer-
ence to a practical life, Theophrastus to a contem·
plative, Ι have set my mind on making it clear that
1 have humoured them both. l take it Ι have fully
satished Dicaearchus: now I am turning my eye to
the other school, ¹which not only gives me permission
to take my ease now, but blames me for ever having
done anything else. So, my deur Titus, let me throw
myself heart aud soul into those excellent studies,
