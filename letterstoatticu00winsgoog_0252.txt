LETTERS TO ATTICUS 111. 17

cronno Το auricus, canarius. ·

All the news I have had about my brother Quintus T lem·
from June the 3rd to the end of August has been loniva, Sepl-
bad news without exception. But on the last of l, Μ 58
August Livineius, who had been sent by his former Δ
master, L. ReguluS, came to me. He assured me that
no notice whatever had been given of a prosecution
though there was some talk of C. Clodius' son under-
taking one : and he brought me letters from Quintus
himself. But on the next day came some of Sestius’

-men, with some letters of yours which are not so
positive and alarming as Livineius' conversation was.
My own unending distress of course reuders me
anxious all the more so, as Appius would preside at
the trial.

From the rest of your remarks in the same letter ,
as to my own chanceS, l infer that our hopes are fain-
ter than others make out. But since it will not be
long now before the matter is settled, l will either
remove to your house or still stay somewhere round
here.

: My brother writes that you alone are his support.
I need not urge you to efforts, which you make of
your own accord, nor will I offer my thankS, since you
do not expect them. 1 only hope fate may allow us
to enjoy our affection in safety. l am always looking
eagerly for your letters: and please don’t be afraid
either of boring me with your minuteness or paining
me by telling the truth.
