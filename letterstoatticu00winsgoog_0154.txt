LETTERS TO ATTICUS ΙΙ. 9

me is not kept,I am in the seventh heaven with
delight at thinking how that J erusalemite plebeian-
monger will learn what a pretty return he has made
for all my ehoieest panegyries: and you may expect
recantation of eclipsing brillianey3 for, so far as Ι ean
see, if that good-for-nothing is in favour with our

‘ “ex-consul with a oynic’s tongue '' and those “ Tri·

more quickly to be sure than it might have done.

Count me too big a dunee to have learned any·
thing by experienoe or from Theophrastus if you
do not see very shortly men mourning for the days
of my government. Foris the power of the Senate
was unpopular, you can imagine what things will be
like now, when the power has been transferred not
to the people, but to three unbridled men. So let
them make anyone they like consuls and tribunes,
