LETTERS TO ATTICUS 111. 13-14

Instead of blaming me so often for taking my ,
’ troubles so seriously‚ you ought to pardon me, as you
see that my afflictione surpass all that you have ever
seen or heard of. You say you have heard that mymind
is becoming unhinged with grief: my mind is sound
enough. Would that it had been as sound in the
hour of danger, when Ι found those ¹my cruelest
enemies who 1 thought had my salvation most at - ,
hear-t As soon as they saw Ι had lost my balance a
little through fear, they used all their mallee and
treachery to thrust me to ‘my doom. Now that 1
have to go to Cyzicus where your letters will reach
me less frequently, please be all the more careful to
give me a thorough account of everything you think
l ought to know. Be a good friend to my brother
QuintuS, for, if I leave him unharmed by my fall, 1
, shall not regard myself as utterly overwhelmed

· Your letter has filled me with hopes of Pompey’s Thessalo.
λ intentions or professed intentions as regards me. For nico, Juty
Ι think the electioris have been held, and it is when 21, nc, 58
’ they are over you say he has 'decided to have my
affair brought forward. 11 you think me foolish sor
’ hoping, 1 only do what you bid me to do, and I know
· your letters generally are more inclined to restrain me
and my hopes than to encourage them. Now please
tell me plainly and fully what you see. l know it is
through many saulis ο1 my own that 1 have fallen
into this misery: and if fate mends my faults even
¹ 'partially,l shall be less disgusted both with my past ¹

and my ⁴present existence.
