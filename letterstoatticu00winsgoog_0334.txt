LETTERS TO ATTICUS lV. 16

In Pilia's business Ι will be sure to do what you ⁸
suggest: for, as you say, the point is quite clear on
Aurelianus' evidence. And it will give me a chance
of glorifying myself in my Tullia’a eyes. I am sup-
porting Vestorius: for Ι see you regard it as a favour,
. and Imake him see it too. But you know the kind oi
manha is: frightfully difficult to get on with, even
for two such easy-going people. .

, Now for your questions about C. Cato. You know
he was acquitted under the Juniau and Liciniam
law. The Fufian law will aequit him too, l assure
you, and that as much to the relies of his accusers as
of his supporters. However, he has made his peace
with Milo and myself. Drusus is being prosecuted
by Lucretius. The day for challenging the jury is
fixed for the 3rd of July. About Procilius there are

³ sinister rumours: but you know what juriea are.

Hirrus is on good terms with Domitius. The decree
which these consuls have carried about the provinces,
“whosoever henceforth,” etc.,I do not think will
have any effect.

Ι don't know what to say to your question about ἲ
Messalla: Ι have never seen candidates more evenly
matched. Yon know Messalla’s support. Scaurus
bas been called into court by Triarius3 without any
great sympathy for him being aroused, if you want to .

2 know. However his aedileahip recalls no unpleaaant

memorieS, and their remembrance of his father has
some weight with the country voters. The other
two plebeian candidates are about equal,as Domitius
is strong in friends and his very popular gladiatorial
exhibition will count for him too, while Memmius is
popular with Caesar’s soldiers and relies on the sup·
port of Pompey's Gaul. If that does not avail him,
