Lamnus ro Amrcus 1v. 17

secretsthat we cannot even trust an amanuensis as Ι
a mle, for fear of some jest leaking out.
The consuls’ infamy has had a lurid light thrown

on it owing to C. Memmius, one of the candidates ’

· reading out in the Senate an agreement made by
himself and his fellow-candidate Domitius with them.
·1f they were elected to the consulship, they were
both to give the consuls 2350 each, if they did not
produce three augurs who would depose that they
were present at the carrying of a lca cunata—which
had never been passed3 and two err-consuls who
would depose to having been present at the drasting
of a decree for the fitting out of the consular provinces
-though there had never been any meeting of the
Senate about it at all. As this compact was alleged
not to be a mere verbal compact, but one properly
drawn up with the sums promised on it, drasts on the
bank, and marry other documents, Memmius exhibi-
ted it, with all the items entered,l on the suggestion
of Pompey. It was all the same to Appius: he had
nothing to lose by it. The other has had a sad come.-
down,andlmay say is quite donefor. Memmius,how-
ever, having dissolved the coalition against Calvinus’
will, has sunk out of mind, and his ruin is all the more ’
irretrievable because we know now that his disclosure
annoyed Caesar very much. Our friend Messalla and
his fellow-competitor Domitius were very liberal to
the people, and could not be more popular. They are
certain of electiori. But the Senate has decreed that a
trial with closed doors should be held before the elec-

’ tione, and each candidate's conduct inquired into by

the panels chosen by lot for all of them. The candi-

'dates are ina great fright: butsome of they'ury-among
