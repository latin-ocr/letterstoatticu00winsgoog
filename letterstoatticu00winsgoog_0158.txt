LETTERS TO ATTICUS 11. 10-11

foolish plcasure too. So 1 shall wait for you till the
rth of May at Formiae. Now let me know what day
Ishall sce you. From Appi Forum at 10 o'clock. 1
sent another letter a little earlier from the Three
Taverns.

XI
crosno 'ro aeneus, anuarino.

1 assure you Ι feel an absolute exile since l have been F anniae,
at Formiae. There never was a day when Ι was at April>
Antium that Ι was not better up in the news of Rome Μ· 5 9
than those who were living there. The fact is your
letters used to set before me not only the city news,
but all the politioal news, and not only what was
happening, but what was going to happen too. Now
I can't get to know anything, unless I piok up chance
news froin a passing traveller. So, although Iam
expectihg you here very soon, give this man of mine,
who is under orders to return at once, a bulky mis-
sive, full of news of all that has happened and what
you think about it: and don’t forget to say what day
you are leaving Rome. I intend to stay at Formiae
till the oth of May. If you can't get here before
that date, perhaps Ι shall see you at Rome, for Ι can
hardly invite you to Arpinum.

My rugged native land, good nurse for men; Odrwerix. 27
None other would mine eyes so gladly see.

*that is all then. Take care of yourself.
