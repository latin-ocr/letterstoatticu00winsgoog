Lamnas To anneus 11. 20

negotiation: as soon as any certain conclusion is
reached, Ι will write to you. If l have to hght,l ’
will summon you to share my labour: but if l am
lest in peace, Ι will not rout you out of your Amal·
thea

Political matters Ι shall only touch on briefly: for
Ι am beginning to be afraid that the very paper may ·
betray me. 'So in futiire, if Ι have to write in fuller
detail to you, Ι shall hide my meaning under covert
language. Now the State is dying of a new disease. ’
The mensures that have been passed cause universal
discontent and grumbling and indignation: there is
no disagreement on the point and people· are now
” venting their opinion and their disapproval openly
ι and loudly, yet no remedy is applied. Resistonce
J seems impossible without bloodshed: nor ean we see
any other end to concession except destruction.
{ Bibulus is exalted to the skies amid universal admira-
tion and popularity. His edicts and speeches are
copied out and read. He has attained the height of
glory inquito a novel way. Nothing is so popular
now as hatred of the popular party. Ι have my fears
about the issue of all this. But lwill write more
clearly, if Ι get any definite v'iews. Do you, if your
affection forme is as real as l know it to be, hold
J yourself ready ιο run to my eall, when it comes. But
, l am doing my best, and will continue to do it, to
prevent any necessity. Ι said Ι would call you Furius
in my letters, but there is no need to alter your
name. I will call myself Laelius and you Atticus,
and l won't use my own handwriting or seal, at any
i rate if the letters are such that 1 should not like
= them to fall into a stranger’s hands.
