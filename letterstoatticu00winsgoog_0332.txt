LETTERS TO ATTICUS IV. 16

have put the discussion in the mouths of Africanus,

Philus, Laelius and Manilius, adding the youths Q. Tu-
bero, P. Rutilius and the two sons-in-law of Laelius,
Scaevola and Fannius So Ι am thinking of contriving

, someway of mentioning him appropriately—forthatl

think is what you want—in one of the introductions.
Ι am giving an introduction to each book, as Aristotle
does in the work he called the Exoten'cs. And Ι only
hope Ι may manage to get him in. Foras you fully
comprehend, Ι have set my hand to a subject of wide
range ¹and of some difficulty, which requires much
leisure3 and that is precisely what Ι have not got.
While praising those books, you miss the character
of Scaevola from the scene. It was not without good
reason that Ι removed him. Our god Plato did the
same in his Republla When Socrates called on that
wealthy and cheery old soul Cephalus in the Piraeus,
the old man takes part in the discussion during the
introductory conversation3 but atter a very neat
speech, he pleads that he wants to go to a divine
. service, and does not come back again. Ι fancy
Plato thought it would have been inartistic to keep
a man of that age any longer in so lengthy a discus-
sion. Ι thought there was still more reason to be
careful in the‘ case of Scaevola, who was at the age

, and in the state of health'in which you must re-

member he was, and was crowned with such honours
that it would hardly have been proper for him to
spend several days with Crassus at his villa at Tuscu·

, lum. BesideS, the talk in the first book was not

unconnected with Scaevola's pursuits: while the
remaining books contained a technical discussion, as
you know„ In such I did not like the merry old
man, you remember, to take a part. ’
