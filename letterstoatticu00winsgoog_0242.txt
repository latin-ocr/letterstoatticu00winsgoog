LETTERS TO ATTICUS ΙΙΙ. 15

have lost,-you know it well enough, and it would
only open my wound again. But this Ι do assert that
no one has ever lost so much and no one has ever
fallen into such a depth of misery. Time too, instead
of lightening my grief, can but add to it: for other “
sorrows lose their sting as time passes, but my sorrow

attentioris have not been -es conspicuous as they
